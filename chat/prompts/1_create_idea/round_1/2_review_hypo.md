kind: hypothesis
title: Visual Uncertainty-Aware Conformal Cache Admission with Adaptive Bias
hypothesis: >-
  Cache admission decisions can be improved by using visual foundation models to extract semantic patterns from request streams,
  generating prediction intervals via conformal prediction for admissibility confidence, and adaptively adjusting admission
  bias based on prediction uncertainty (higher bias when confident, more exploration when uncertain).
motivation: >-
  Current cache admission policies use simple heuristics (TinyLFU, ARC2, Bloom filters) or basic learning signals, yet they
  struggle with both high-uncertainty content (new patterns, shifting trends) and over-conservative admission that wastes
  cache slots. No existing work combines visual semantic understanding with uncertainty-aware adaptive bias - a gap that limits
  performance in content-rich systems where hot/cold clusters are dynamically rich and semantically structured.
assumptions:
- >-
  Request stream content has exploitable semantic structure (can be vectorized by visual foundation models)
- >-
  Conformal prediction intervals can be reliably computed from historical miss patterns to quantify uncertainty
- >-
  Visual semantic patterns generalize to unseen content beyond training distribution
- System has stable tracking of historical item-level miss rates over time
investigation_approach: >-
  Develop a system that (1) extracts visual embeddings from cached items using ViT/CLIP foundation model, (2) computes historical
  miss rates per semantic cluster and generates conformal prediction intervals, (3) defines confidence-adaptive bias function:
  higher bias for high-confidence predictions (speculative admission), lower bias for low-confidence (conservative exploration),
  (4) implements cache admission filter using this adaptive bias pattern, (5) evaluates against TinyLFU, ARC2, and standard
  LRU on trace-driven benchmarks with controlled uncertainty regimes (stationary hot clusters, sudden popularity shifts, cold
  start scenarios).
success_criteria: >-
  The visual uncertainty-aware conformal system should achieve (a) at least 15% higher throughput and 10% lower request latency
  compared to TinyLFU/ARC2 in mixed high-uncertainty scenarios, (b) proportional improvements in specific regimes: 30%+ better
  in popularity-shift settings where old patterns become uncertain, 25%+ better in cold-start bandwidth scenarios, (c) calibration
  where predicted confidence intervals match actual miss rate variances.
related_works:
- >-
  Chameleon (2025) - adaptive caching for LLMs with workload-aware policies (arXiv:2512.08414), but no uncertainty quantification
  or semantic visual understanding
- >-
  Learning to Cache and Caching to Learn (2020) - bandit-based caching with regret optimization (arXiv:2004.00472), but applies
  fixed policy, not confidence-adaptive bias
- >-
  Optimal Service Caching and Pricing (TMC 2022) - pricing + caching + bandit learning (10.1109/tmc.2022.3221465), but focuses
  on edge markets, not visual semantic admission
- >-
  Can Increasing Hit Ratio Hurt Throughput? (2024) - shows throughput hit ratio tradeoff via queueing theory (arXiv:2404.16219),
  but proposes timing-based models, not adaptive admission bias
- >-
  Conformal prediction tutorial (2007) - distribution-free uncertainty quantification (arXiv:0706.3188), but no caching application
- >-
  A Gentle Introduction to Conformal Prediction (2021) - modern conformal prediction framework (arXiv:2107.07511), but no
  caching application
- >-
  Prompt, Generate, Then Cache (CVPR 2023) - caches foundation model prompts (10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01460), not general cache
  admission
- >-
  Cloud-Edge Graph Learning Caching (JSS 2023) - GNN-structured caching (10.1109/jsyst.2023.3262255), no visual or uncertainty
  components
inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer combining (1) conformal prediction from statistical learning theory for uncertainty-aware prediction
  intervals, (2) visual foundation models (ViT/CLIP) from computer vision to mine semantic patterns from raw content, (3)
  confidence-adaptive algorithms from control theory and reinforcement learning where exploration vs exploitation rates depend
  on estimated uncertainty.
terms:
- term: Conformal Prediction
  definition: >-
    A distribution-free framework for generating prediction intervals that provably maintain coverage guarantees under exchangeability
    assumptions, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification for any machine learning model.
- term: Confidence-Adaptive Bias
  definition: >-
    A dynamic adjustment to cache rules (e.g., LRU age threshold) where parameter values scale with prediction confidence:
    higher confidence enables more speculative admission, lower confidence forces more conservative exploration.
- term: Visual Semantic Embedding
  definition: >-
    Vector representations extracted from visual or multimodal content via foundation models (ViT, CLIP) that capture semantic
    structure and similarity patterns between items beyond basic hash or feature extraction.
- term: Cache Admission Bias
  definition: >-
    Parameter modifications applied to standard cache policies (e.g., adjusting TinyLFU's approximate counting threshold)
    to prioritize admission of certain item types over other while avoiding pollution.
summary: >-
  A novel cache admission mechanism that uses visual foundation models to extract semantic patterns from cached items, generates
  formal prediction intervals via conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty, and adaptively adjusts admission bias based
  on prediction confidence. This hybrid approach enables speculative admission of high-confidence semantically similar hot
  items while conserving cache slots for uncertain or low-probability patterns.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Runs web search, page fetch as markdown, and regex grep over full HTML or PDF text via this skill's own scripts (aii_fast_web_search.py, aii_fast_web_fetch.py) — a free-first keyless search stack with Serper fallback that works even where built-in WebSearch and WebFetch are absent. Use when a query, page, or paper must be searched, read, or mined for an exact quote, number, table value, or methodology sentence, and whenever a lossy summary would lose the detail. Triggers: web search, scholarly search, OpenAlex, Crossref, Serper, fetch a URL as markdown, read a PDF, arXiv, regex grep a page, exact quote, table value, citation check. NOT for: planning a broad multi-source literature review or mass verification campaign — use aii-web-research-tools; NOT for a PDF file already on disk — extraction, form filling, merging and PDF creation are anthropic-pdf; NOT for driving a browser or testing a UI."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Visual Uncertainty-Aware Conformal Cache Admission with Adaptive Bias
hypothesis: >-
  Cache admission decisions can be improved by using visual foundation models to extract semantic patterns from request streams,
  generating prediction intervals via conformal prediction for admissibility confidence, and adaptively adjusting admission
  bias based on prediction uncertainty (higher bias when confident, more exploration when uncertain).
motivation: >-
  Current cache admission policies use simple heuristics (TinyLFU, ARC2, Bloom filters) or basic learning signals, yet they
  struggle with both high-uncertainty content (new patterns, shifting trends) and over-conservative admission that wastes
  cache slots. No existing work combines visual semantic understanding with uncertainty-aware adaptive bias - a gap that limits
  performance in content-rich systems where hot/cold clusters are dynamically rich and semantically structured.
assumptions:
- >-
  Request stream content has exploitable semantic structure (can be vectorized by visual foundation models)
- >-
  Conformal prediction intervals can be reliably computed from historical miss patterns to quantify uncertainty
- >-
  Visual semantic patterns generalize to unseen content beyond training distribution
- System has stable tracking of historical item-level miss rates over time
investigation_approach: >-
  Develop a system that (1) extracts visual embeddings from cached items using ViT/CLIP foundation model, (2) computes historical
  miss rates per semantic cluster and generates conformal prediction intervals, (3) defines confidence-adaptive bias function:
  higher bias for high-confidence predictions (speculative admission), lower bias for low-confidence (conservative exploration),
  (4) implements cache admission filter using this adaptive bias pattern, (5) evaluates against TinyLFU, ARC2, and standard
  LRU on trace-driven benchmarks with controlled uncertainty regimes (stationary hot clusters, sudden popularity shifts, cold
  start scenarios).
success_criteria: >-
  The visual uncertainty-aware conformal system should achieve (a) at least 15% higher throughput and 10% lower request latency
  compared to TinyLFU/ARC2 in mixed high-uncertainty scenarios, (b) proportional improvements in specific regimes: 30%+ better
  in popularity-shift settings where old patterns become uncertain, 25%+ better in cold-start bandwidth scenarios, (c) calibration
  where predicted confidence intervals match actual miss rate variances.

inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer combining (1) conformal prediction from statistical learning theory for uncertainty-aware prediction
  intervals, (2) visual foundation models (ViT/CLIP) from computer vision to mine semantic patterns from raw content, (3)
  confidence-adaptive algorithms from control theory and reinforcement learning where exploration vs exploitation rates depend
  on estimated uncertainty.
terms:
- term: Conformal Prediction
  definition: >-
    A distribution-free framework for generating prediction intervals that provably maintain coverage guarantees under exchangeability
    assumptions, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification for any machine learning model.
- term: Confidence-Adaptive Bias
  definition: >-
    A dynamic adjustment to cache rules (e.g., LRU age threshold) where parameter values scale with prediction confidence:
    higher confidence enables more speculative admission, lower confidence forces more conservative exploration.
- term: Visual Semantic Embedding
  definition: >-
    Vector representations extracted from visual or multimodal content via foundation models (ViT, CLIP) that capture semantic
    structure and similarity patterns between items beyond basic hash or feature extraction.
- term: Cache Admission Bias
  definition: >-
    Parameter modifications applied to standard cache policies (e.g., adjusting TinyLFU's approximate counting threshold)
    to prioritize admission of certain item types over other while avoiding pollution.
summary: >-
  A novel cache admission mechanism that uses visual foundation models to extract semantic patterns from cached items, generates
  formal prediction intervals via conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty, and adaptively adjusts admission bias based
  on prediction confidence. This hybrid approach enables speculative admission of high-confidence semantically similar hot
  items while conserving cache slots for uncertain or low-probability patterns.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

title: Visual Uncertainty-Aware Conformal Cache Admission with Adaptive Bias
hypothesis: >-
  Cache admission decisions can be improved by using visual foundation models to extract semantic patterns from request streams,
  generating prediction intervals via conformal prediction for admissibility confidence, and adaptively adjusting admission
  bias based on prediction uncertainty (higher bias when confident, more exploration when uncertain).
motivation: >-
  Current cache admission policies use simple heuristics (TinyLFU, ARC2, Bloom filters) or basic learning signals, yet they
  struggle with both high-uncertainty content (new patterns, shifting trends) and over-conservative admission that wastes
  cache slots. No existing work combines visual semantic understanding with uncertainty-aware adaptive bias - a gap that limits
  performance in content-rich systems where hot/cold clusters are dynamically rich and semantically structured.
assumptions:
- >-
  Request stream content has exploitable semantic structure (can be vectorized by visual foundation models)
- >-
  Conformal prediction intervals can be reliably computed from historical miss patterns to quantify uncertainty
- >-
  Visual semantic patterns generalize to unseen content beyond training distribution
- System has stable tracking of historical item-level miss rates over time
investigation_approach: >-
  Develop a system that (1) extracts visual embeddings from cached items using ViT/CLIP foundation model, (2) computes historical
  miss rates per semantic cluster and generates conformal prediction intervals, (3) defines confidence-adaptive bias function:
  higher bias for high-confidence predictions (speculative admission), lower bias for low-confidence (conservative exploration),
  (4) implements cache admission filter using this adaptive bias pattern, (5) evaluates against TinyLFU, ARC2, and standard
  LRU on trace-driven benchmarks with controlled uncertainty regimes (stationary hot clusters, sudden popularity shifts, cold
  start scenarios).
success_criteria: >-
  The visual uncertainty-aware conformal system should achieve (a) at least 15% higher throughput and 10% lower request latency
  compared to TinyLFU/ARC2 in mixed high-uncertainty scenarios, (b) proportional improvements in specific regimes: 30%+ better
  in popularity-shift settings where old patterns become uncertain, 25%+ better in cold-start bandwidth scenarios, (c) calibration
  where predicted confidence intervals match actual miss rate variances.

kind: hypothesis
title: Visual Uncertainty-Aware Conformal Cache Admission with Adaptive Bias
hypothesis: >-
  Cache admission decisions can be improved by using visual foundation models to extract semantic patterns from request streams,
  generating prediction intervals via conformal prediction for admissibility confidence, and adaptively adjusting admission
  bias based on prediction uncertainty (higher bias when confident, more exploration when uncertain).
motivation: >-
  Current cache admission policies use simple heuristics (TinyLFU, ARC2, Bloom filters) or basic learning signals, yet they
  struggle with both high-uncertainty content (new patterns, shifting trends) and over-conservative admission that wastes
  cache slots. No existing work combines visual semantic understanding with uncertainty-aware adaptive bias - a gap that limits
  performance in content-rich systems where hot/cold clusters are dynamically rich and semantically structured.
assumptions:
- >-
  Request stream content has exploitable semantic structure (can be vectorized by visual foundation models)
- >-
  Conformal prediction intervals can be reliably computed from historical miss patterns to quantify uncertainty
- >-
  Visual semantic patterns generalize to unseen content beyond training distribution
- System has stable tracking of historical item-level miss rates over time
investigation_approach: >-
  Develop a system that (1) extracts visual embeddings from cached items using ViT/CLIP foundation model, (2) computes historical
  miss rates per semantic cluster and generates conformal prediction intervals, (3) defines confidence-adaptive bias function:
  higher bias for high-confidence predictions (speculative admission), lower bias for low-confidence (conservative exploration),
  (4) implements cache admission filter using this adaptive bias pattern, (5) evaluates against TinyLFU, ARC2, and standard
  LRU on trace-driven benchmarks with controlled uncertainty regimes (stationary hot clusters, sudden popularity shifts, cold
  start scenarios).
success_criteria: >-
  The visual uncertainty-aware conformal system should achieve (a) at least 15% higher throughput and 10% lower request latency
  compared to TinyLFU/ARC2 in mixed high-uncertainty scenarios, (b) proportional improvements in specific regimes: 30%+ better
  in popularity-shift settings where old patterns become uncertain, 25%+ better in cold-start bandwidth scenarios, (c) calibration
  where predicted confidence intervals match actual miss rate variances.
related_works:
- >-
  Chameleon (2025) - adaptive caching for LLMs with workload-aware policies (arXiv:2512.08414), but no uncertainty quantification
  or semantic visual understanding
- >-
  Learning to Cache and Caching to Learn (2020) - bandit-based caching with regret optimization (arXiv:2004.00472), but applies
  fixed policy, not confidence-adaptive bias
- >-
  Optimal Service Caching and Pricing (TMC 2022) - pricing + caching + bandit learning (10.1109/tmc.2022.3221465), but focuses
  on edge markets, not visual semantic admission
- >-
  Can Increasing Hit Ratio Hurt Throughput? (2024) - shows throughput hit ratio tradeoff via queueing theory (arXiv:2404.16219),
  but proposes timing-based models, not adaptive admission bias
- >-
  Conformal prediction tutorial (2007) - distribution-free uncertainty quantification (arXiv:0706.3188), but no caching application
- >-
  A Gentle Introduction to Conformal Prediction (2021) - modern conformal prediction framework (arXiv:2107.07511), but no
  caching application
- >-
  Prompt, Generate, Then Cache (CVPR 2023) - caches foundation model prompts (10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01460), not general cache
  admission
- >-
  Cloud-Edge Graph Learning Caching (JSS 2023) - GNN-structured caching (10.1109/jsyst.2023.3262255), no visual or uncertainty
  components
inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer combining (1) conformal prediction from statistical learning theory for uncertainty-aware prediction
  intervals, (2) visual foundation models (ViT/CLIP) from computer vision to mine semantic patterns from raw content, (3)
  confidence-adaptive algorithms from control theory and reinforcement learning where exploration vs exploitation rates depend
  on estimated uncertainty.
terms:
- term: Conformal Prediction
  definition: >-
    A distribution-free framework for generating prediction intervals that provably maintain coverage guarantees under exchangeability
    assumptions, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification for any machine learning model.
- term: Confidence-Adaptive Bias
  definition: >-
    A dynamic adjustment to cache rules (e.g., LRU age threshold) where parameter values scale with prediction confidence:
    higher confidence enables more speculative admission, lower confidence forces more conservative exploration.
- term: Visual Semantic Embedding
  definition: >-
    Vector representations extracted from visual or multimodal content via foundation models (ViT, CLIP) that capture semantic
    structure and similarity patterns between items beyond basic hash or feature extraction.
- term: Cache Admission Bias
  definition: >-
    Parameter modifications applied to standard cache policies (e.g., adjusting TinyLFU's approximate counting threshold)
    to prioritize admission of certain item types over other while avoiding pollution.
summary: >-
  A novel cache admission mechanism that uses visual foundation models to extract semantic patterns from cached items, generates
  formal prediction intervals via conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty, and adaptively adjusts admission bias based
  on prediction confidence. This hybrid approach enables speculative admission of high-confidence semantically similar hot
  items while conserving cache slots for uncertain or low-probability patterns.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Visual Uncertainty-Aware Conformal Cache Admission with Adaptive Bias
hypothesis: >-
  Cache admission decisions can be improved by using visual foundation models to extract semantic patterns from request streams,
  generating prediction intervals via conformal prediction for admissibility confidence, and adaptively adjusting admission
  bias based on prediction uncertainty (higher bias when confident, more exploration when uncertain).
motivation: >-
  Current cache admission policies use simple heuristics (TinyLFU, ARC2, Bloom filters) or basic learning signals, yet they
  struggle with both high-uncertainty content (new patterns, shifting trends) and over-conservative admission that wastes
  cache slots. No existing work combines visual semantic understanding with uncertainty-aware adaptive bias - a gap that limits
  performance in content-rich systems where hot/cold clusters are dynamically rich and semantically structured.
assumptions:
- >-
  Request stream content has exploitable semantic structure (can be vectorized by visual foundation models)
- >-
  Conformal prediction intervals can be reliably computed from historical miss patterns to quantify uncertainty
- >-
  Visual semantic patterns generalize to unseen content beyond training distribution
- System has stable tracking of historical item-level miss rates over time
investigation_approach: >-
  Develop a system that (1) extracts visual embeddings from cached items using ViT/CLIP foundation model, (2) computes historical
  miss rates per semantic cluster and generates conformal prediction intervals, (3) defines confidence-adaptive bias function:
  higher bias for high-confidence predictions (speculative admission), lower bias for low-confidence (conservative exploration),
  (4) implements cache admission filter using this adaptive bias pattern, (5) evaluates against TinyLFU, ARC2, and standard
  LRU on trace-driven benchmarks with controlled uncertainty regimes (stationary hot clusters, sudden popularity shifts, cold
  start scenarios).
success_criteria: >-
  The visual uncertainty-aware conformal system should achieve (a) at least 15% higher throughput and 10% lower request latency
  compared to TinyLFU/ARC2 in mixed high-uncertainty scenarios, (b) proportional improvements in specific regimes: 30%+ better
  in popularity-shift settings where old patterns become uncertain, 25%+ better in cold-start bandwidth scenarios, (c) calibration
  where predicted confidence intervals match actual miss rate variances.
related_works:
- >-
  Chameleon (2025) - adaptive caching for LLMs with workload-aware policies (arXiv:2512.08414), but no uncertainty quantification
  or semantic visual understanding
- >-
  Learning to Cache and Caching to Learn (2020) - bandit-based caching with regret optimization (arXiv:2004.00472), but applies
  fixed policy, not confidence-adaptive bias
- >-
  Optimal Service Caching and Pricing (TMC 2022) - pricing + caching + bandit learning (10.1109/tmc.2022.3221465), but focuses
  on edge markets, not visual semantic admission
- >-
  Can Increasing Hit Ratio Hurt Throughput? (2024) - shows throughput hit ratio tradeoff via queueing theory (arXiv:2404.16219),
  but proposes timing-based models, not adaptive admission bias
- >-
  Conformal prediction tutorial (2007) - distribution-free uncertainty quantification (arXiv:0706.3188), but no caching application
- >-
  A Gentle Introduction to Conformal Prediction (2021) - modern conformal prediction framework (arXiv:2107.07511), but no
  caching application
- >-
  Prompt, Generate, Then Cache (CVPR 2023) - caches foundation model prompts (10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01460), not general cache
  admission
- >-
  Cloud-Edge Graph Learning Caching (JSS 2023) - GNN-structured caching (10.1109/jsyst.2023.3262255), no visual or uncertainty
  components
inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer combining (1) conformal prediction from statistical learning theory for uncertainty-aware prediction
  intervals, (2) visual foundation models (ViT/CLIP) from computer vision to mine semantic patterns from raw content, (3)
  confidence-adaptive algorithms from control theory and reinforcement learning where exploration vs exploitation rates depend
  on estimated uncertainty.
terms:
- term: Conformal Prediction
  definition: >-
    A distribution-free framework for generating prediction intervals that provably maintain coverage guarantees under exchangeability
    assumptions, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification for any machine learning model.
- term: Confidence-Adaptive Bias
  definition: >-
    A dynamic adjustment to cache rules (e.g., LRU age threshold) where parameter values scale with prediction confidence:
    higher confidence enables more speculative admission, lower confidence forces more conservative exploration.
- term: Visual Semantic Embedding
  definition: >-
    Vector representations extracted from visual or multimodal content via foundation models (ViT, CLIP) that capture semantic
    structure and similarity patterns between items beyond basic hash or feature extraction.
- term: Cache Admission Bias
  definition: >-
    Parameter modifications applied to standard cache policies (e.g., adjusting TinyLFU's approximate counting threshold)
    to prioritize admission of certain item types over other while avoiding pollution.
summary: >-
  A novel cache admission mechanism that uses visual foundation models to extract semantic patterns from cached items, generates
  formal prediction intervals via conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty, and adaptively adjusts admission bias based
  on prediction confidence. This hybrid approach enables speculative admission of high-confidence semantically similar hot
  items while conserving cache slots for uncertain or low-probability patterns.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.
