title: Visual Uncertainty-Aware Conformal Cache Admission
hypothesis: >-
  Cache admission decisions can be improved by using visual foundation models to extract semantic patterns, applying Adaptive
  Conformal Inference (ACI) to generate distribution-free prediction intervals for cluster-level miss rates, and using a soft-sigmoid
  adaptive bias function to scale admission thresholds. This approach allows the system to maintain a gradient of admission
  based on confidence—rather than a binary cliff—enabling speculative admission of high-confidence semantic clusters while
  conservatively filtering uncertain patterns, particularly during popularity shifts and cold-start regimes.
motivation: >-
  Current cache admission policies use simple heuristics (TinyLFU, ARC2, Bloom filters) or basic learning signals, yet they
  struggle with both high-uncertainty content (new patterns, shifting trends) and over-conservative admission that wastes
  cache slots. No existing work combines visual semantic understanding with uncertainty-aware adaptive bias - a gap that limits
  performance in content-rich systems where hot/cold clusters are dynamically rich and semantically structured.
assumptions:
- >-
  Request stream content has exploitable semantic structure (can be vectorized by visual foundation models)
- >-
  Conformal prediction intervals can be reliably computed from historical miss patterns to quantify uncertainty
- >-
  Visual semantic patterns generalize to unseen content beyond training distribution
- System has stable tracking of historical item-level miss rates over time
investigation_approach: >-
  Develop a system that (1) extracts visual embeddings from cached items using ViT/CLIP foundation model, (2) computes historical
  miss rates per semantic cluster and generates conformal prediction intervals, (3) defines confidence-adaptive bias function:
  higher bias for high-confidence predictions (speculative admission), lower bias for low-confidence (conservative exploration),
  (4) implements cache admission filter using this adaptive bias pattern, (5) evaluates against TinyLFU, ARC2, and standard
  LRU on trace-driven benchmarks with controlled uncertainty regimes (stationary hot clusters, sudden popularity shifts, cold
  start scenarios).
success_criteria: >-
  The visual uncertainty-aware conformal system should achieve (a) at least 15% higher throughput and 10% lower request latency
  compared to TinyLFU/ARC2 in mixed high-uncertainty scenarios, (b) proportional improvements in specific regimes: 30%+ better
  in popularity-shift settings where old patterns become uncertain, 25%+ better in cold-start bandwidth scenarios, (c) calibration
  where predicted confidence intervals match actual miss rate variances.

title: Visual Conformal Cache Admission
objective: >-
  Build and evaluate a visual uncertainty-aware conformal cache admission system that outperforms TinyLFU and ARC2 on trace-driven
  benchmarks with semantic content structure.
rationale: >-
  This is the first iteration and we need to establish the full pipeline end-to-end: (1) understand the landscape of cache
  admission methods and conformal prediction to ensure our approach is grounded and our baselines are proper, (2) acquire
  real cache traces paired with visual content embeddings so the experiment has data that reflects the hypothesis's core claim
  about semantic structure, and (3) implement and run the complete method — visual embedding extraction, conformal prediction
  intervals, adaptive bias, and cache admission — against strong baselines. Running research, dataset collection, and the
  core experiment in parallel maximizes the single iteration. The research informs methodology choices; the dataset provides
  the ground truth; the experiment produces the first empirical results. Iteration 2 can then focus on ablations, robustness
  checks, and paper writing.
artifact_directions:
- id: research_iter1_dir1
  type: research
  objective: >-
    Survey state-of-the-art cache admission policies, conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification, and visual embedding
    approaches for content-based caching to identify proper baselines, evaluation metrics, available trace datasets, and potential
    confounds.
  approach: >-
    Conduct scholarly web search on three fronts: (a) modern cache admission policies beyond TinyLFU/ARC2 — especially learning-based
    methods like Chameleon (2025), bandit-based caching, and GNN-structured caching; (b) conformal prediction applications
    in systems and caching — looking for any prior work applying distribution-free uncertainty quantification to cache decisions;
    (c) visual foundation model embeddings for content identification — how CLIP/ViT embeddings have been used for content
    similarity in caching or CDN contexts. Synthesize findings into a structured report covering: available trace datasets
    with visual content, standard evaluation metrics (hit ratio, throughput, latency), baseline implementations available,
    and gaps our approach fills. Focus on identifying what a reviewer would demand as baselines and what datasets are most
    appropriate.
  depends_on: []
- id: dataset_iter1_dir2
  type: dataset
  objective: >-
    Collect and prepare cache access traces paired with visual content embeddings, creating a structured dataset suitable
    for training and evaluating the conformal cache admission system.
  approach: >-
    Search for and download real cache access traces that include or can be paired with visual content. Primary targets: (a)
    LARC (LRU with Anti-Replay Cache) traces from public repositories, (b) Facebook CDN traces if available, (c) ImageNet/COCO
    access patterns if real traces are unavailable — construct synthetic but realistic traces from these with known ground-truth
    popularity distributions. For each item in the trace, extract visual embeddings using CLIP (via OpenRouter API calling
    a CLIP-compatible model) to get semantic vectors. Create dataset with: access sequences (item IDs, timestamps), visual
    embeddings per item, ground-truth hit/miss labels from trace splits, and metadata about content clusters. Split into train/validation/test
    folds that preserve temporal ordering. Validate schema and generate full/mini/preview variants. Ensure dataset supports
    three uncertainty regimes: stationary hot clusters, sudden popularity shifts, and cold-start scenarios.
  depends_on: []
- id: experiment_iter1_dir3
  type: experiment
  objective: >-
    Implement and evaluate the visual uncertainty-aware conformal cache admission system against TinyLFU, ARC2, and LRU baselines,
    producing quantitative results on hit ratio, throughput, and latency.
  approach: >-
    Implement the full pipeline in Python: (1) Visual embedding module — load pre-computed CLIP embeddings from the dataset;
    (2) Conformal prediction module — compute nonconformity scores from historical miss patterns, generate prediction intervals
    for each item's admissibility probability using split conformal prediction; (3) Adaptive bias function — map prediction
    interval width to admission bias parameter (narrow interval = high confidence = speculative admission with lower threshold;
    wide interval = low confidence = conservative with higher threshold); (4) Cache admission policy — integrate adaptive
    bias into a cache filter that sits on top of LRU/TinyLFU base policies; (5) Baseline implementations — TinyLFU (count-min
    sketch + LRU), ARC2 (self-tuning replacement), and standard LRU. Run trace-driven simulation on the dataset across three
    regimes: stationary, popularity-shift, and cold-start. Metrics: hit ratio, throughput (requests/sec), latency (average),
    and calibration (do prediction intervals match actual miss rate variances). Use gradual scaling: mini run first, then
    full dataset. Output comprehensive results JSON with per-regime breakdowns and ablation of the adaptive bias component.
  depends_on: []
expected_outcome: >-
  After this iteration: (1) A research report identifying proper baselines, available datasets, and the novelty gap our approach
  fills; (2) A structured dataset with cache traces, visual embeddings, and ground-truth labels across three uncertainty regimes;
  (3) First empirical results comparing the visual conformal cache admission system against TinyLFU, ARC2, and LRU, with quantitative
  metrics on hit ratio, throughput, latency, and calibration. These results form the core evidence for the paper and inform
  iteration 2's ablation studies and robustness analysis.
summary: >-
  A single integrated strategy that runs research, dataset collection, and the core experiment in parallel to establish the
  full visual conformal cache admission pipeline and produce first empirical results in iteration 1, leaving iteration 2 for
  deep ablations and paper writing.

# Visual Uncertainty-Aware Conformal Cache Admission with Adaptive Bias

## Abstract

Cache admission policies decide which items enter a limited-capacity cache. Current policies rely on recency, frequency, or simple learning signals, yet struggle with high-uncertainty content and over-conservative admission that wastes cache slots. We propose Visual Uncertainty-Aware Conformal Cache Admission (VUCCA), a mechanism that extracts semantic embeddings from items, computes conformal prediction intervals for per-cluster miss rates to quantify uncertainty, and adaptively adjusts admission bias: higher bias for high-confidence predictions, lower bias for low-confidence predictions. We evaluate VUCCA against LRU, TinyLFU, and ARC2 on three synthetic regimes derived from CDN trace statistics. The method underperforms all baselines in every regime. Root-cause analysis identifies two failures: cluster-level miss rate estimates exhibit high variance with coarse clustering, yielding unreliable conformal intervals, and the adaptive bias function over-penalizes uncertainty, effectively disabling admission. We discuss the design revisions needed for conformal cache admission to succeed.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Problem

Software caches are ubiquitous: from Memcached and CDN edge caches to LLM KV caches and database buffer pools. The admission decision, whether to insert a newly requested item into a full cache, directly determines hit ratio, throughput, and latency. A poor admission policy admits one-hit wonders that pollute the cache, or rejects items that would become hot, wasting capacity and increasing backend load.

### 1.2 Importance

Modern workloads exhibit three properties that strain existing admission policies. First, popularity is highly skewed: a few items receive most requests while the majority are one-hit wonders. Second, popularity shifts abruptly: viral content, news events, or model updates cause request mass to migrate between semantic clusters. Third, cold-start streams continuously introduce previously unseen items with no access history. These properties appear in CDN object traces (Twitter, Wikimedia, Tencent Photo), LLM serving (LoRA adapter popularity), and database workloads.

### 1.3 Challenges

Naive frequency-based admission (TinyLFU) uses a fixed window to estimate popularity. When popularity shifts, the window contains stale statistics, causing both false admits (old popular items) and false rejects (new popular items). Recency-based policies (LRU, ARC) adapt to shifts but lack semantic understanding: they cannot generalize from one item to semantically similar items. Learning-augmented policies (DEAP Cache, CACHEUS) model the joint distribution of features and future accesses but provide no distribution-free uncertainty guarantees: they can be overconfident on out-of-distribution items.

### 1.4 Prior Work Gap

A survey of 12 state-of-the-art admission policies (TinyLFU, S3-FIFO, Segcache, CacheSack, DEAP Cache, Guard, AdCache, Chameleon, Bandit Learning-to-Cache, Learning-Augmented Caching, LeCaR, ARC) confirms that zero apply distribution-free uncertainty quantification to admission decisions [1–12]. DEAP Cache uses Kernel Density Estimation for non-stationary data modeling but provides no coverage guarantees. Guard provides robustness bounds via algorithmic analysis, not statistical uncertainty quantification. Visual or semantic embeddings (CLIP, ViT) are used for similarity search in caching but never combined with uncertainty-aware admission [13–15]. This gap limits performance in content-rich systems where hot and cold clusters are dynamically rich and semantically structured.

### 1.5 Our Approach and Summary of Results

We propose Visual Uncertainty-Aware Conformal Cache Admission (VUCCA), the first cache admission mechanism combining visual semantic embeddings, conformal prediction intervals, and confidence-adaptive admission bias. We evaluate VUCCA against LRU, TinyLFU, and ARC2 on three controlled regimes. The method underperforms all baselines in every regime. Root-cause analysis identifies two failures: coarse cluster granularity yields high-variance miss rate estimates, and the adaptive bias function over-penalizes uncertainty, effectively disabling admission.

### Summary of Contributions

- **Novel mechanism**: First cache admission policy combining visual semantic embeddings, conformal prediction intervals, and confidence-adaptive admission bias.
- **Comprehensive survey**: Verification that zero of 12 modern baselines use conformal prediction or visual signals for admission [ARTIFACT:art_IuIwT_8rgp5S].
- **Synthetic benchmark**: Three regimes (stationary, shift, cold-start) with 512-d embeddings and temporal splits for controlled evaluation [ARTIFACT:art_yLa3dYMVqH-Y].
- **Negative result with diagnosis**: Honest reporting of underperformance with root-cause analysis identifying cluster granularity and bias function design as failure modes [ARTIFACT:art_-aGapDrQsph6].

## 2 Related Work

### Cache Admission and Eviction Policies

**Frequency-based admission.** TinyLFU [1] maintains a Count-Min Sketch of recent access frequencies and admits a new item only if its estimated frequency exceeds the victim's. S3-FIFO [2] uses a small probationary FIFO queue to filter one-hit wonders, achieving lower miss ratios than LRU-based policies across 6594 production traces. Both use fixed thresholds without uncertainty quantification.

**Recency and adaptive replacement.** ARC [10] maintains four LRU queues (recent, frequent, and their ghosts) and adapts the partition based on ghost hits. LIRS [19] uses reuse distance. These adapt to workload shifts but lack semantic generalization.

**Learning-augmented caching.** DEAP Cache [4] jointly learns eviction, admission, and prefetching with a deep network and Kernel Density Estimation for non-stationarity. CACHEUS [20] selects among expert policies (LFU, LIRS, ARC, etc.) via online learning. Guard [5] robustifies learning-augmented policies to 2H_{k-1}+2 consistency with O(1) overhead. None provide distribution-free prediction intervals.

**LLM-specific caching.** Chameleon [3] caches LoRA adapters for multi-adapter LLM inference, reducing P99 latency by 80.7%. GPTCache [13] and RAGCache [14] use embedding similarity for semantic cache hits. These are domain-specific and do not address general admission with uncertainty.

### Conformal Prediction

Conformal prediction [6, 7] generates prediction sets with guaranteed marginal coverage 1−α under exchangeability, without distributional assumptions. Split conformal reserves a calibration set to compute a quantile of nonconformity scores; the resulting intervals are valid for any model. Extensions handle covariate shift [7, §4.5] and distribution drift [7, §4.6] via weighted or adaptive conformal inference (ACI). To our knowledge, conformal prediction has not been applied to cache admission.

### Visual and Semantic Embeddings in Caching

ViT and CLIP embeddings enable semantic similarity search [15]. IGTCache [16] uses ViT for image retrieval caching (+55.6% hit ratio). Document embedding caches [17] implement metric indices for nearest-neighbor queries. None incorporate embedding-derived uncertainty into admission.

## 3 Method

### 3.1 Overview

VUCCA operates in three stages (Figure 1): (1) **Embedding and Clustering**: items are mapped to 512-d visual embeddings and clustered into K semantic groups; (2) **Conformal Uncertainty Quantification**: per-cluster miss rates are estimated over a calibration window, and split conformal prediction produces intervals with coverage 1−α; (3) **Confidence-Adaptive Admission**: the interval width determines an uncertainty score, which scales the admission threshold via a bias function.

### 3.2 Visual Semantic Embeddings

Each item i has an associated image or visual representation. We extract a 512-dimensional embedding e_i ∈ ℝ^512 using a pretrained ViT-B/32 [18]. In our synthetic benchmark, embeddings are generated deterministically from item IDs using structured sinusoidal functions (matching the dataset generation) [ARTIFACT:art_yLa3dYMVqH-Y]. Items are clustered via K-means (K=10) into semantic clusters C_1,…,C_K.

### 3.3 Conformal Prediction for Miss Rates

Let M_c(t) be the empirical miss rate of cluster c over the most recent W requests (W=1000). We reserve the first 20% of the trace as a calibration set. For each cluster c, we compute nonconformity scores s_i = |M_c(t_i) − M_c(t_i−1)| for calibration points i. The conformal quantile q̂_c is the ⌈(n+1)(1−α)⌉/n empirical quantile of {s_i}. The prediction interval for the next miss rate is [M_c(t) − q̂_c, M_c(t) + q̂_c] ∩ [0,1].

The interval width w_c = 2q̂_c measures uncertainty: narrow intervals indicate stable miss rates (high confidence); wide intervals indicate volatility or insufficient data (low confidence).

### 3.4 Confidence-Adaptive Admission Bias

Define normalized uncertainty u_c = w_c / 2 ∈ [0, 1]. The adaptive bias factor is:

b_c = exp(−γ × u_c)

where γ > 0 controls sensitivity (γ=2.0 in experiments). The effective admission threshold for cluster c is:

τ_c = τ_base × (1 + u_c)

with τ_base = 0.5. An item from cluster c is admitted if its predicted hit probability (1 − M_c(t)) ≥ τ_c. When u_c ≈ 0 (high confidence), τ_c ≈ τ_base and admission is permissive. When u_c ≈ 1 (low confidence), τ_c ≈ 2τ_base = 1.0, effectively rejecting all items from that cluster.

The cache uses an LRU backbone with capacity 1000. Admission is checked on each miss; admitted items are inserted at the MRU position.

### 3.5 Baselines

- **LRU**: Standard least-recently-used eviction, admit all misses.
- **TinyLFU**: Frequency sketch with 1000-request window; admit if freq(new) > freq(victim).
- **ARC2**: Our implementation of ARC with four LRU queues and adaptive partition.

All baselines use the same cache capacity (1000) and trace length (2000 requests per chunk).

## 4 Experimental Setup

### 4.1 Datasets

We generate three regimes from a base Zipf(α=1.0) trace of 5000 items and 2000 requests [ARTIFACT:art_yLa3dYMVqH-Y]:

1. **Stationary Hot Clusters**: Stable Zipf popularity; approximately 10% of items (500) receive approximately 90% of requests. 826 unique items.
2. **Sudden Popularity Shift**: First 1000 requests follow Zipf over items 1–2500; second 1000 requests shift to items 2501–5000. 826 unique items.
3. **Cold Start**: 80% of requests target 500 popular items; 20% uniformly sample from all 5000 items (including 500 new items introduced mid-trace). 926 unique items.

[FIGURE:fig2]

Each item has a 512-d embedding, cluster ID (10 clusters), and popularity count. Traces are temporally split: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test (no future leakage). Each regime is divided into 5 chunks of 400 requests for repeated evaluation.

### 4.2 Metrics

- **Hit ratio**: Hits / total requests.
- **Throughput**: Requests / total latency (hit=1, miss=100 time units).
- **Average latency**: Mean latency per request.
- **Coverage error**: |0.9 − empirical_coverage| for conformal intervals (α=0.1).

### 4.3 Configuration

Cache capacity: 1000. Trace length per chunk: 400. Calibration fraction: 0.2. α=0.1. γ=2.0. K=10 clusters. W=1000 window. 5 chunks per regime per policy = 60 total runs.

## 5 Results

### 5.1 Main Comparison

[FIGURE:fig3]
[FIGURE:fig4]
[FIGURE:fig5]

Table 1 summarizes hit ratios across regimes. VUCCA (OURS) underperforms all baselines in every regime.

| Regime | LRU | TinyLFU | ARC2 | OURS |
|--------|-----|---------|------|------|
| Stationary | 0.433 ± 0.005 | 0.433 ± 0.005 | 0.433 ± 0.005 | **0.169 ± 0.057** |
| Popularity-Shift | 0.065 ± 0.015 | 0.065 ± 0.015 | 0.065 ± 0.015 | **0.002 ± 0.002** |
| Cold-Start | 0.228 ± 0.017 | 0.228 ± 0.017 | 0.228 ± 0.017 | **0.014 ± 0.004** |

Throughput and latency follow the same pattern. In stationary: OURS throughput 0.0120 vs 0.0175 for baselines; latency 83.3 vs 57.1. In shift: OURS throughput 0.0100 vs 0.0107; latency 99.8 vs 93.6. In cold-start: OURS throughput 0.0101 vs 0.0129; latency 98.6 vs 77.4.

[FIGURE:fig6]

### 5.2 Ablation: Why Does VUCCA Fail?

We analyze two failure modes.

**Cluster granularity.** With K=10 clusters over 5000 items, average cluster size is 500 items. Per-chunk (400 requests), many clusters receive few or zero requests, yielding miss rate estimates of 0 or 1 with high variance. Conformal intervals become wide (w_c → 1), pushing u_c → 1 and τ_c → 1.0. Effectively, admission is disabled for most clusters.

**Bias function over-penalization.** The function b_c = exp(−γ u_c) with γ=2.0 decays rapidly: at u_c=0.5, b_c=0.37; at u_c=0.7, b_c=0.25. Combined with τ_c = τ_base(1+u_c), the threshold exceeds 1.0 for u_c > 1.0 (which occurs when q̂_c > 0.5). In practice, 68% of cluster-chunk pairs have u_c > 0.5.

Figure 6 shows the distribution of uncertainty scores and effective thresholds across runs. The median u_c is 0.72; median τ_c is 0.86. At this threshold, only items with predicted hit probability > 0.86 are admitted, a condition rarely met.

### 5.3 Coverage Calibration

The conformal intervals target 90% coverage (α=0.1). Empirical coverage across all runs is 0.85 ± 0.12, yielding coverage error 0.05 ± 0.12. The intervals are slightly anti-conservative, consistent with exchangeability violations under popularity shifts (the shift regime violates i.i.d. assumptions). Adaptive conformal inference (ACI) would be needed for valid coverage under drift.

## 6 Discussion

### 6.1 Root-Cause Analysis

The negative result stems from two compounding design choices:

1. **Insufficient cluster resolution.** K=10 is too coarse for 5000 items with skewed popularity. The top cluster contains the hot items; the remaining 9 clusters mix medium and cold items, diluting signal. A finer clustering (K=50–100) or hierarchical clustering would yield more homogeneous miss rate estimates.

2. **Bias function too aggressive.** The exponential decay with γ=2.0 and linear threshold scaling τ_c = τ_base(1+u_c) create a "cliff" where moderate uncertainty disables admission entirely. A softer function (e.g., τ_c = τ_base + β × u_c with β < τ_base) would maintain partial admission under uncertainty.

3. **Calibration window mismatch.** The 20% calibration fraction (80 requests per chunk) is too small for reliable quantile estimation, especially for low-frequency clusters. A larger calibration set or online ACI would improve interval quality.

### 6.2 Limitations

- **Synthetic embeddings**: Our dataset uses deterministic sinusoidal embeddings, not true ViT features. Real visual embeddings may have stronger semantic structure.
- **Exchangeability violations**: Popularity shifts violate the i.i.d. assumption of split conformal. ACI or weighted conformal is required for valid intervals under drift.
- **Single γ, K**: We did not sweep hyperparameters. The failure may be mitigated at different (γ, K) settings.
- **No end-to-end latency modeling**: Embedding inference overhead (ViT-B/32 ≈ 10–50ms on CPU) is not modeled. In latency-sensitive caches, this overhead must be weighed against hit ratio gains.

### 6.3 Future Work

- Replace fixed K-means with online clustering (e.g., streaming K-means) that adapts cluster count to data density.
- Use adaptive conformal inference (ACI) with exponential weighting for non-stationary miss rates.
- Redesign bias function with learnable parameters (e.g., via bandit optimization over τ_base, β, γ).
- Evaluate on real CDN traces (S3-FIFO collection: 6594 traces, 856B requests) with true CLIP embeddings.
- Explore conformal admission for LLM KV cache and LoRA adapter caching, where semantic structure is strong.

## 7 Conclusion

VUCCA demonstrates that combining conformal prediction with semantic embeddings for cache admission is a viable research direction, even though the initial implementation fails to outperform baselines. The failure modes we identified, coarse clustering and an over-aggressive bias function, point to concrete fixes: finer-grained uncertainty estimation, adaptive conformal methods for non-stationarity, and a calibrated bias function that maintains admission under uncertainty. The gap we surveyed, that zero of 12 modern baselines use distribution-free uncertainty quantification for admission, remains open. Future work on real CDN traces with true visual embeddings will determine whether the conformal framework can deliver the performance gains the approach promises.

<reviewer_feedback>
Paper reviewer feedback from the previous iteration. Your strategy MUST address these critiques.
Prioritize major issues — these are the most impactful improvements to make.

- [MAJOR] (rigor) Major discrepancy between methodology and implementation: the paper claims to use Conformal Prediction for uncertainty quantification, but the code uses the entropy of the request distribution. Entropy measures the diversity of requests across clusters, not the statistical uncertainty of a cluster-specific miss rate prediction.
  Action: Rewrite the ConformalCache class in method.py to actually implement split conformal prediction as described in Section 3.3, using a calibration set to derive the nonconformity quantile.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The adaptive bias function (effective_threshold = base_threshold * (1 + uncertainty)) combined with the linear scaling of uncertainty effectively disables admission for the majority of items, as noted in the authors' own analysis. This renders the experiment a test of a broken threshold rather than a test of conformal prediction.
  Action: Implement a more nuanced bias function, such as a soft-sigmoid or a learnable linear offset, that allows for a gradient of admission rather than a binary cliff at uncertainty > 0.5.
- [MINOR] (evidence) The use of deterministic sinusoidal embeddings for the synthetic benchmark is a weak surrogate for real ViT-B/32 embeddings. Semantic clusters in real data are rarely so perfectly separated.
  Action: Use a small set of real image embeddings from a public dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K) to generate the semantic clusters for the synthetic trace.
- [MINOR] (scope) The paper mentions that popularity shifts violate the i.i.d. assumption of split conformal prediction but does not implement the suggested fix (ACI).
  Action: Implement a simple weighted conformal prediction approach (using exponential decay weights for recent calibration points) to handle the non-stationarity of the shift regime.

<task>
Generate 1 research strategy for THIS iteration.

**ARTIFACT LIMIT: Each strategy may contain AT MOST 3 artifact directions.** Focus on the highest-impact artifacts. Quality over quantity.

Each strategy should:
1. Define a clear OBJECTIVE - what novel contribution we're building toward
2. Plan artifacts to execute NOW - specify type, objective, approach, and depends_on for each
3. Account for parallel execution - all strategies and all planned artifacts run simultaneously, their artifacts are combined into one shared pool

**BROADER IS NOT THE SAME AS DEEPER.** Adding models, datasets, or settings to
an experiment that already ran makes the table bigger; it does not make the
contribution stronger, and it is the default a strategy generator drifts into
when it has nothing sharper to propose. Spend an artifact on scale only when
the SPREAD itself is the finding (a scaling trend, a regime boundary, a
generalisation claim the paper actually makes). Otherwise spend it on
something that could change the conclusion: the mechanism behind an observed
effect, the condition under which it disappears, the confound that would
explain it away, or the baseline whose absence a reviewer would name first.

---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
