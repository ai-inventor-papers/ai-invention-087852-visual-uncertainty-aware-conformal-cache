type: dataset
title: Visual cache access trace dataset
summary: >-
  Build three cache-access trace datasets (stationary hot clusters, popularity shift, cold-start), each pairing a real request
  sequence + per-item popularity with real images and locally-extracted CLIP embeddings, plus per-item cluster/popularity
  metadata, split by temporal order. This supplies the raw inputs the downstream conformal-cache-admission experiment needs
  to replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU and the new method.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  The ideal dataset pairs a REAL request trace (item IDs, ordered request sequence, timestamps, per-item request counts showing
  Zipf/heavy-skew popularity) with REAL images so that CLIP embeddings and semantic clusters are genuine and reproducible.
  Concretely: 1,000–20,000 unique items per regime with ~100k–1M total requests; each item carries a 512-d CLIP (ViT-B/32)
  embedding, a semantic cluster id, and its true popularity (request count); PLUS the full ordered request sequence is retained
  (not collapsed to aggregates) so the experiment can replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU/bandit/Chameleon policies and compute hit/miss.
  Total footprint under ~300MB. Three regimes with distinct dynamics. Folds split by timestamp (temporal order preserved,
  no future leakage). The dataset must be raw data ONLY: NO hit/miss labels, conformal intervals, or admission decisions should
  be computed here — those are downstream experiment/derived outputs.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  CRITICAL CORRECTION TO THE DIRECTION: (1) OpenRouter does NOT expose CLIP/image-embedding endpoints — it is a text-LLM gateway. Extract embeddings LOCALLY instead using open_clip_torch (ViT-B/32, 512-d) or transformers.CLIPModel on CPU; this also means the $10 OpenRouter budget is not needed for this artifact. (2) Real cache traces (Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, SNIA IOTTA block traces) ship item IDs + request sequences + counts but NOT the image bytes, so visual embeddings cannot come from the trace itself — the access pattern and the images must come from two real sources and be paired procedurally.

  PHASE A — Acquire real access-pattern ground truth: Search HuggingFace and GitHub for public cache/CDN trace datasets. Named candidates to check: (a) the Caffeine simulator traces (github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Simulator, Traces section) which reference the Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, Gloe/S3/UMass traces; (b) the pennshen trace repos on GitHub (LC/CacheLib-traces / PBC) hosting large CDN traces; (c) SNIA IOTTA block-I/O repository (iotta.snia.org). Use aii-hf-datasets search (queries: 'cache trace', 'cdn access log', 'web trace', 'request trace') and aii-web-tools search as fallback. Goal: an ordered request stream + per-item request counts that exhibit heavy-tailed popularity. If no directly loadable trace is found, RECORD the trace's Zipf/skew statistics and request-count distribution and use them as the ground-truth generator for the request sequences (still real-derived, not fabricated ab initio).

  PHASE B — Acquire real images: Use aii-hf-datasets to pull a loadable image corpus — ImageNet-1k subset (via timm/HF mirror) or COCO (e.g. a HF coco/ image subset) is preferred for real semantic clusters (animals, vehicles, food, scenes). Target a few thousand down to 20k images. Confirm 'loadable=True' before choosing.

  PHASE C — Pair and embed: Assign each trace item to a real image deterministically (seeded), cluster items by image class/label into a 'cluster_id' column. Extract 512-d CLIP embeddings locally (CLIP ViT-B/32, CPU-batch, float32→float16 if needed for size).

  PHASE D — Construct THREE regime datasets (this is the 'construct synthetic but realistic traces' step from the direction, applied per regime): (1) Stationary hot clusters — stable Zipf popularity, a few dominant hot clusters; (2) Sudden popularity shift — request mass migrates from old clusters to new ones midway through the sequence; (3) Cold-start — a stream of previously-unseen items with no warm-up. Keep the request sequence ordered with timestamps in each.

  PHASE E — Split by temporal order into train/validation/test (no shuffling across time), write each item as a row {item_id, request_sequence_or_ordered_events, timestamp, embedding (float list), cluster_id, popularity_count, regime, metadata_fold}. Validate against the repo schema with aii-json, and generate full/mini/preview variants. Final output paths: full_*.json, mini_*.json, preview_*.json per regime.

  FAILURE HANDLING: If no real trace is obtainable/loadable, fall back to real-derived popularity params from the documented traces (Phase A records them first) and represent that provenance explicitly in metadata instead of silently synthesizing. If a single 512-d CLIP model is too heavy for CPU, downscale to ViT-B/32 fp16 or a 128-d projection and note it. Do not compute hit/miss or conformal intervals in this artifact.

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<available_data_sources>
Use the sources appropriate to your task. Read the relevant skill file BEFORE using each source.

- **HuggingFace Hub** (HF) — ML datasets (NLP, vision, tabular, benchmarks)
- **Our World in Data** (OWID) — Global statistics (energy, health, economics, environment, demographics)
- **Alternate methods** — Python/shell (sklearn.datasets, openml, direct URL, APIs, etc.)

If the plan specifies a source or one fits better, use it.
You may combine sources. Use web search (aii-web-tools skill) to research candidates (background, papers, provenance) — NOT to find/download datasets.
</available_data_sources>

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for dataset selection, evaluation metrics, agent orchestration patterns.

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-python, aii-long-running-tasks, aii-json, aii-file-size-limit, aii-use-hardware, aii-parallel-computing.
TODO 2. Read skill files for your data sources (see <available_data_sources>) and domain handbook if applicable (see <available_domain_handbooks>). Based on plan and context, decide which source(s) to use. Include everything specified in the artifact plan, but you may also collect additional relevant data beyond what's listed. Run 24 diverse searches across chosen source(s) — BROAD, GENERAL terms, not very specific. Parallelize where supported.
TODO 3. Identify the 12 most promising datasets. IMPORTANT: Only consider datasets under 300MB. Preview/inspect sample rows for each candidate. Parallelize previews.
TODO 4. Research each candidate BEFORE choosing which to download. For each, search the web (aii-web-tools skill): dataset name, papers citing it, original source/task, popularity. Red flags: no search results, no papers, anonymized features (F1, F2...), <100 downloads, no documentation. Green flags: papers using it, clear documentation, meaningful features, established benchmark. Also consider: will features/structure allow meaningful evaluation of the planned method?
TODO 5. Decide which to KEEP vs DISCARD. Look for: clear structure, relevant fields, quality examples matching requirements, confirmed provenance. Determine which 6 datasets have the most suitable data. Download and save to `temp/datasets/`. Parallelize downloads.

## Contents

- Workflow (3-phase dataset discovery)
- Scripts (Search, Preview, Download)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: 3-Phase Dataset Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Datasets
Find datasets with metadata (configs, splits, features, sizes)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "sentiment analysis" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2: Preview Dataset (if promising)
Inspect metadata AND sample rows in one call
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k
```

### Phase 3: Download Dataset (if suitable)
Download after reviewing the preview
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

---

## Scripts

### Search HuggingFace Datasets (aii_hf_search_datasets.py)

Search and discover datasets on HuggingFace Hub.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "text classification" --limit 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel (venv activate does NOT work in parallel subshells):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --query {} --limit 3' ::: 'sentiment' 'classification' 'translation'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 5 dataset(s) for query='text classification'

============================================================
Dataset 1: stanfordnlp/imdb
Downloads: 2,500,000 | Likes: 1,234
Description: Large Movie Review Dataset for binary sentiment classification...
Tags: text-classification, en, sentiment-analysis
```

**Result fields per dataset:**

Each entry in ``results`` carries:

- ``id`` / ``downloads`` / ``likes`` / ``tags`` / ``description`` — standard
  HF metadata
- ``has_loader_script`` (bool) — repo ships a top-level ``<repo>.py`` loader.
  ``datasets>=3`` won't run these directly; the dataset is reachable only
  via the Datasets Server's pre-converted parquet shards. Treat as a yellow
  flag.
- ``loadable`` (bool) — **prefer datasets where this is ``True``.** Means
  the dataset is reachable via *some* path: either native parquet (no
  script) or HF auto-converted the script's output to parquet. When
  ``False``, the script needs deps HF can't install (e.g. ``conllu``,
  custom audio decoders) and ``aii_hf_datasets__download_datasets`` will
  fail — pick a different candidate.

**Parameters:**

`--query` (optional)
- Search query string
- Example: `--query "sentiment analysis"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Maximum number of results (default: 5)

`--tags` (optional)
- Filter by tags (comma-separated)
- Format: `category:value`
- Examples: `language:en`, `task_categories:text-classification`

`--sort` (optional)
- Sort by field: `downloads`, `likes` (default: downloads)

**Tips:**
- Search displays full dataset metadata
- Use tags to filter: `--tags "language:en,task_categories:translation"`

---

### Preview HuggingFace Dataset (aii_hf_preview_datasets.py)

Inspect a specific dataset - shows metadata AND sample rows.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --num-rows 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple datasets):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {} --num-rows 3' ::: 'openai/gsm8k' 'imdb' 'squad'
```

**Example output:**
```

### Download HuggingFace Dataset (aii_hf_download_datasets.py)

Download datasets and save to files.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

**Parallel execution (multiple datasets):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel. Use `eval {}` pattern when datasets need different flags (e.g. `--config`):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite 'eval {}' ::: '$PY $S openai/gsm8k --config main --split train' '$PY $S imdb --split train' '$PY $S squad --split train'
```

**Example output:**
```
Downloaded: openai/gsm8k

  train:
    Rows: 7,473
    Preview: temp/datasets/preview_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
    Mini: temp/datasets/mini_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
    Full: temp/datasets/full_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
```

**Parameters:**

`dataset_id` (required, positional)
- HuggingFace dataset ID
- Examples: `openai/gsm8k`, `imdb`

`--config` (optional)
- Dataset configuration/subset name
- Use preview to see available configs

`--split` (optional)
- Specific split to load (e.g., `train`, `test`)
- If not specified, loads all splits

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory (default: `temp/datasets/`)

**Output files (auto-saved):**
1. **Preview**: `preview_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **READ THIS** for quick inspection
2. **Mini**: `mini_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 full rows - for development/testing
3. **Full**: `full_{dataset}_{split}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - use as input path for code

**Tips:**
- Only read preview file directly with Read tool
- Mini and full are input paths for processing code

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

  CRITICAL CORRECTION TO THE DIRECTION: (1) OpenRouter does NOT expose CLIP/image-embedding endpoints — it is a text-LLM gateway. Extract embeddings LOCALLY instead using open_clip_torch (ViT-B/32, 512-d) or transformers.CLIPModel on CPU; this also means the $10 OpenRouter budget is not needed for this artifact. (2) Real cache traces (Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, SNIA IOTTA block traces) ship item IDs + request sequences + counts but NOT the image bytes, so visual embeddings cannot come from the trace itself — the access pattern and the images must come from two real sources and be paired procedurally.

  PHASE A — Acquire real access-pattern ground truth: Search HuggingFace and GitHub for public cache/CDN trace datasets. Named candidates to check: (a) the Caffeine simulator traces (github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Simulator, Traces section) which reference the Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, Gloe/S3/UMass traces; (b) the pennshen trace repos on GitHub (LC/CacheLib-traces / PBC) hosting large CDN traces; (c) SNIA IOTTA block-I/O repository (iotta.snia.org). Use aii-hf-datasets search (queries: 'cache trace', 'cdn access log', 'web trace', 'request trace') and aii-web-tools search as fallback. Goal: an ordered request stream + per-item request counts that exhibit heavy-tailed popularity. If no directly loadable trace is found, RECORD the trace's Zipf/skew statistics and request-count distribution and use them as the ground-truth generator for the request sequences (still real-derived, not fabricated ab initio).

  PHASE B — Acquire real images: Use aii-hf-datasets to pull a loadable image corpus — ImageNet-1k subset (via timm/HF mirror) or COCO (e.g. a HF coco/ image subset) is preferred for real semantic clusters (animals, vehicles, food, scenes). Target a few thousand down to 20k images. Confirm 'loadable=True' before choosing.

  PHASE C — Pair and embed: Assign each trace item to a real image deterministically (seeded), cluster items by image class/label into a 'cluster_id' column. Extract 512-d CLIP embeddings locally (CLIP ViT-B/32, CPU-batch, float32→float16 if needed for size).

  PHASE D — Construct THREE regime datasets (this is the 'construct synthetic but realistic traces' step from the direction, applied per regime): (1) Stationary hot clusters — stable Zipf popularity, a few dominant hot clusters; (2) Sudden popularity shift — request mass migrates from old clusters to new ones midway through the sequence; (3) Cold-start — a stream of previously-unseen items with no warm-up. Keep the request sequence ordered with timestamps in each.

  PHASE E — Split by temporal order into train/validation/test (no shuffling across time), write each item as a row {item_id, request_sequence_or_ordered_events, timestamp, embedding (float list), cluster_id, popularity_count, regime, metadata_fold}. Validate against the repo schema with aii-json, and generate full/mini/preview variants. Final output paths: full_*.json, mini_*.json, preview_*.json per regime.

  FAILURE HANDLING: If no real trace is obtainable/loadable, fall back to real-derived popularity params from the documented traces (Phase A records them first) and represent that provenance explicitly in metadata instead of silently synthesizing. If a single 512-d CLIP model is too heavy for CPU, downscale to ViT-B/32 fp16 or a 128-d projection and note it. Do not compute hit/miss or conformal intervals in this artifact.

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. For the top 6 datasets, create data.py (uv inline script) that: loads from temp/datasets/, standardizes to exp_sel_data_out.json schema (aii-json skill), extracts all examples per dataset, handles domain requirements, saves to full_data_out.json.

Each data ROW must be a separate example — do NOT create one example per dataset or per fold. Each data point (row, sample, instance) = one example. 500 rows → 500 examples. The output is GROUPED BY DATASET:
```json
{
  "datasets": [
    {
      "dataset": "iris",
      "examples": [
        {"input": "...", "output": "...", "metadata_fold": 2, "metadata_feature_names": [...]},
        ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "dataset": "adult_census",
      "examples": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```
Per-example required fields:
- `input`: input features/text (tabular: JSON string of feature values)
- `output`: target/label (as string)
Per-example optional metadata via `metadata_<name>` fields (flat, not nested object):
- `metadata_fold`: fold assignment (int), `metadata_feature_names`: feature name list, `metadata_task_type`: "classification"/"regression", `metadata_n_classes`: number of classes, `metadata_row_index`: original row index, etc.
Do NOT use `split`, `dataset`, or `context` as per-example fields. Dataset name goes at the group level, metadata goes in `metadata_*` fields.
TODO 2. Run 'uv run data.py' and fix errors. Validate full_data_out.json against exp_sel_data_out.json schema (aii-json skill) — fix errors. Generate preview, mini, full versions with aii-json skill's format script.
TODO 3. Read preview to inspect examples. Choose THE BEST 3 DATASETS based on domain requirements and artifact objective. Be very attentive to meticulously and exhaustively fix any errors in your code.

id: gen_plan_dataset_1_idx2
type: dataset
title: Visual cache access trace dataset
summary: >-
  Build three cache-access trace datasets (stationary hot clusters, popularity shift, cold-start), each pairing a real request
  sequence + per-item popularity with real images and locally-extracted CLIP embeddings, plus per-item cluster/popularity
  metadata, split by temporal order. This supplies the raw inputs the downstream conformal-cache-admission experiment needs
  to replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU and the new method.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  The ideal dataset pairs a REAL request trace (item IDs, ordered request sequence, timestamps, per-item request counts showing
  Zipf/heavy-skew popularity) with REAL images so that CLIP embeddings and semantic clusters are genuine and reproducible.
  Concretely: 1,000–20,000 unique items per regime with ~100k–1M total requests; each item carries a 512-d CLIP (ViT-B/32)
  embedding, a semantic cluster id, and its true popularity (request count); PLUS the full ordered request sequence is retained
  (not collapsed to aggregates) so the experiment can replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU/bandit/Chameleon policies and compute hit/miss.
  Total footprint under ~300MB. Three regimes with distinct dynamics. Folds split by timestamp (temporal order preserved,
  no future leakage). The dataset must be raw data ONLY: NO hit/miss labels, conformal intervals, or admission decisions should
  be computed here — those are downstream experiment/derived outputs.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  CRITICAL CORRECTION TO THE DIRECTION: (1) OpenRouter does NOT expose CLIP/image-embedding endpoints — it is a text-LLM gateway. Extract embeddings LOCALLY instead using open_clip_torch (ViT-B/32, 512-d) or transformers.CLIPModel on CPU; this also means the $10 OpenRouter budget is not needed for this artifact. (2) Real cache traces (Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, SNIA IOTTA block traces) ship item IDs + request sequences + counts but NOT the image bytes, so visual embeddings cannot come from the trace itself — the access pattern and the images must come from two real sources and be paired procedurally.

  PHASE A — Acquire real access-pattern ground truth: Search HuggingFace and GitHub for public cache/CDN trace datasets. Named candidates to check: (a) the Caffeine simulator traces (github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Simulator, Traces section) which reference the Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, Gloe/S3/UMass traces; (b) the pennshen trace repos on GitHub (LC/CacheLib-traces / PBC) hosting large CDN traces; (c) SNIA IOTTA block-I/O repository (iotta.snia.org). Use aii-hf-datasets search (queries: 'cache trace', 'cdn access log', 'web trace', 'request trace') and aii-web-tools search as fallback. Goal: an ordered request stream + per-item request counts that exhibit heavy-tailed popularity. If no directly loadable trace is found, RECORD the trace's Zipf/skew statistics and request-count distribution and use them as the ground-truth generator for the request sequences (still real-derived, not fabricated ab initio).

  PHASE B — Acquire real images: Use aii-hf-datasets to pull a loadable image corpus — ImageNet-1k subset (via timm/HF mirror) or COCO (e.g. a HF coco/ image subset) is preferred for real semantic clusters (animals, vehicles, food, scenes). Target a few thousand down to 20k images. Confirm 'loadable=True' before choosing.

  PHASE C — Pair and embed: Assign each trace item to a real image deterministically (seeded), cluster items by image class/label into a 'cluster_id' column. Extract 512-d CLIP embeddings locally (CLIP ViT-B/32, CPU-batch, float32→float16 if needed for size).

  PHASE D — Construct THREE regime datasets (this is the 'construct synthetic but realistic traces' step from the direction, applied per regime): (1) Stationary hot clusters — stable Zipf popularity, a few dominant hot clusters; (2) Sudden popularity shift — request mass migrates from old clusters to new ones midway through the sequence; (3) Cold-start — a stream of previously-unseen items with no warm-up. Keep the request sequence ordered with timestamps in each.

  PHASE E — Split by temporal order into train/validation/test (no shuffling across time), write each item as a row {item_id, request_sequence_or_ordered_events, timestamp, embedding (float list), cluster_id, popularity_count, regime, metadata_fold}. Validate against the repo schema with aii-json, and generate full/mini/preview variants. Final output paths: full_*.json, mini_*.json, preview_*.json per regime.

  FAILURE HANDLING: If no real trace is obtainable/loadable, fall back to real-derived popularity params from the documented traces (Phase A records them first) and represent that provenance explicitly in metadata instead of silently synthesizing. If a single 512-d CLIP model is too heavy for CPU, downscale to ViT-B/32 fp16 or a 128-d projection and note it. Do not compute hit/miss or conformal intervals in this artifact.

- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \

```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Experiment Pipeline** — the four formats `schemas/` actually holds and
`AVAILABLE_FORMATS` in `scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py` accepts (this
list used to name six hypothesis-selection schemas that exist nowhere and
omit the proof one; corrected 2026-09-03):
- `exp_sel_data_out.json` - Experiment Data Selection format
- `exp_gen_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Generation format
- `exp_eval_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Evaluation format
- `exp_proof_out.json` - Experiment Proof format

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

id: gen_plan_dataset_1_idx2
type: dataset
title: Visual cache access trace dataset
summary: >-
  Build three cache-access trace datasets (stationary hot clusters, popularity shift, cold-start), each pairing a real request
  sequence + per-item popularity with real images and locally-extracted CLIP embeddings, plus per-item cluster/popularity
  metadata, split by temporal order. This supplies the raw inputs the downstream conformal-cache-admission experiment needs
  to replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU and the new method.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  The ideal dataset pairs a REAL request trace (item IDs, ordered request sequence, timestamps, per-item request counts showing
  Zipf/heavy-skew popularity) with REAL images so that CLIP embeddings and semantic clusters are genuine and reproducible.
  Concretely: 1,000–20,000 unique items per regime with ~100k–1M total requests; each item carries a 512-d CLIP (ViT-B/32)
  embedding, a semantic cluster id, and its true popularity (request count); PLUS the full ordered request sequence is retained
  (not collapsed to aggregates) so the experiment can replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU/bandit/Chameleon policies and compute hit/miss.
  Total footprint under ~300MB. Three regimes with distinct dynamics. Folds split by timestamp (temporal order preserved,
  no future leakage). The dataset must be raw data ONLY: NO hit/miss labels, conformal intervals, or admission decisions should
  be computed here — those are downstream experiment/derived outputs.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  CRITICAL CORRECTION TO THE DIRECTION: (1) OpenRouter does NOT expose CLIP/image-embedding endpoints — it is a text-LLM gateway. Extract embeddings LOCALLY instead using open_clip_torch (ViT-B/32, 512-d) or transformers.CLIPModel on CPU; this also means the $10 OpenRouter budget is not needed for this artifact. (2) Real cache traces (Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, SNIA IOTTA block traces) ship item IDs + request sequences + counts but NOT the image bytes, so visual embeddings cannot come from the trace itself — the access pattern and the images must come from two real sources and be paired procedurally.

  PHASE A — Acquire real access-pattern ground truth: Search HuggingFace and GitHub for public cache/CDN trace datasets. Named candidates to check: (a) the Caffeine simulator traces (github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Simulator, Traces section) which reference the Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, Gloe/S3/UMass traces; (b) the pennshen trace repos on GitHub (LC/CacheLib-traces / PBC) hosting large CDN traces; (c) SNIA IOTTA block-I/O repository (iotta.snia.org). Use aii-hf-datasets search (queries: 'cache trace', 'cdn access log', 'web trace', 'request trace') and aii-web-tools search as fallback. Goal: an ordered request stream + per-item request counts that exhibit heavy-tailed popularity. If no directly loadable trace is found, RECORD the trace's Zipf/skew statistics and request-count distribution and use them as the ground-truth generator for the request sequences (still real-derived, not fabricated ab initio).

  PHASE B — Acquire real images: Use aii-hf-datasets to pull a loadable image corpus — ImageNet-1k subset (via timm/HF mirror) or COCO (e.g. a HF coco/ image subset) is preferred for real semantic clusters (animals, vehicles, food, scenes). Target a few thousand down to 20k images. Confirm 'loadable=True' before choosing.

  PHASE C — Pair and embed: Assign each trace item to a real image deterministically (seeded), cluster items by image class/label into a 'cluster_id' column. Extract 512-d CLIP embeddings locally (CLIP ViT-B/32, CPU-batch, float32→float16 if needed for size).

  PHASE D — Construct THREE regime datasets (this is the 'construct synthetic but realistic traces' step from the direction, applied per regime): (1) Stationary hot clusters — stable Zipf popularity, a few dominant hot clusters; (2) Sudden popularity shift — request mass migrates from old clusters to new ones midway through the sequence; (3) Cold-start — a stream of previously-unseen items with no warm-up. Keep the request sequence ordered with timestamps in each.

  PHASE E — Split by temporal order into train/validation/test (no shuffling across time), write each item as a row {item_id, request_sequence_or_ordered_events, timestamp, embedding (float list), cluster_id, popularity_count, regime, metadata_fold}. Validate against the repo schema with aii-json, and generate full/mini/preview variants. Final output paths: full_*.json, mini_*.json, preview_*.json per regime.

  FAILURE HANDLING: If no real trace is obtainable/loadable, fall back to real-derived popularity params from the documented traces (Phase A records them first) and represent that provenance explicitly in metadata instead of silently synthesizing. If a single 512-d CLIP model is too heavy for CPU, downscale to ViT-B/32 fp16 or a 128-d projection and note it. Do not compute hit/miss or conformal intervals in this artifact.

- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for dataset selection, evaluation metrics, agent orchestration patterns.

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-python, aii-long-running-tasks, aii-json, aii-file-size-limit, aii-use-hardware, aii-parallel-computing.
TODO 2. Read skill files for your data sources (see <available_data_sources>) and domain handbook if applicable (see <available_domain_handbooks>). Based on plan and context, decide which source(s) to use. Include everything specified in the artifact plan, but you may also collect additional relevant data beyond what's listed. Run 24 diverse searches across chosen source(s) — BROAD, GENERAL terms, not very specific. Parallelize where supported.
TODO 3. Identify the 12 most promising datasets. IMPORTANT: Only consider datasets under 300MB. Preview/inspect sample rows for each candidate. Parallelize previews.
TODO 4. Research each candidate BEFORE choosing which to download. For each, search the web (aii-web-tools skill): dataset name, papers citing it, original source/task, popularity. Red flags: no search results, no papers, anonymized features (F1, F2...), <100 downloads, no documentation. Green flags: papers using it, clear documentation, meaningful features, established benchmark. Also consider: will features/structure allow meaningful evaluation of the planned method?
TODO 5. Decide which to KEEP vs DISCARD. Look for: clear structure, relevant fields, quality examples matching requirements, confirmed provenance. Determine which 6 datasets have the most suitable data. Download and save to `temp/datasets/`. Parallelize downloads.

name: aii-python
description: "Applies this repo's Python conventions to experiment and evaluation scripts: uv-only environment setup (never pip), loguru logging with stdout plus a rotating file sink, @logger.catch(reraise=True) with explicit exception types, pathlib file access, type hints, and a standard main() script skeleton. ALWAYS read before writing or editing any Python script that runs an experiment, evaluation, or data-processing job. Triggers: writing or refactoring a Python script, uv venv, uv pip install, pyproject dependencies, loguru, logging setup, try/except and error handling, pathlib, script structure, Python 3.12. NOT for: parallelism, GPU throughput or hardware sizing (use aii-parallel-computing and aii-use-hardware), scaling long autonomous jobs (use aii-long-running-tasks), splitting oversized output files (use aii-file-size-limit), calling LLMs (use aii-openrouter-llms), or notebooks meant for Colab (use aii-colab)."
---

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.12+
- **NEVER use `pip` or `.venv/bin/pip`** — they are not installed. Use `uv` for ALL package operations:
  ```bash
  uv venv .venv --python=3.12
  source .venv/bin/activate  # or: .venv/bin/python script.py
  uv pip install pandas loguru  # NOT: pip install
  ```
- Create `.toml` file with dependencies, create uv `.venv` and activate it
- NO inline dependencies (no `# /// script` headers)

## Logging

Use `loguru` for all logging. Add a file sink alongside stdout.

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove()  # Remove default handler
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")
```

Rules:
- Log every major step (data loading, processing start/end, results)
- If applicable, log every LLM API call input and output
- Truncate long outputs in logs (add truncation logic for potentially large strings)
- Use `logger.error()` in except blocks (traceback auto-captured)

## Error Handling

- Wrap major operations in try/except blocks
- Use `@logger.catch(reraise=True)` decorator on main functions — without `reraise=True`, the script exits 0 even on uncaught exceptions, hiding failures from downstream consumers
- Use explicit exception types, not bare `except:`
- Never silently swallow exceptions — always log them

```python
@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    try:
        data = load_data(path)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error("Data file not found")
        raise
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.error("Invalid JSON in data file")
        raise
```

## Code Structure

- Use `pathlib.Path` for file operations: `Path("data/input.json").read_text()` not `open(...).read()`
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use keyword arguments for functions with more than 4 parameters
- No hardcoded paths — derive from script location or accept as arguments

## Script Pattern

Standard pattern for experiment/evaluation scripts:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Brief description of what this script does."""

from loguru import logger
from pathlib import Path
import json
import sys

logger.remove()
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")

@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    # Load data
    data_path = Path("full_data_out.json")
    logger.info(f"Loading data from {data_path}")
    data = json.loads(data_path.read_text())
    logger.info(f"Loaded {len(data['examples'])} examples")

    # Process
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(data["examples"]):
        try:
            result = process(example)
            results.append(result)
        except Exception:
            logger.error(f"Failed on example {i}")
            continue

    # Save output
    output = {"examples": results}
    Path("method_out.json").write_text(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
    logger.info(f"Saved {len(results)} results")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

name: aii-use-hardware
description: "Detects the CPU, RAM, GPU and VRAM actually available — cgroup v1 and v2 container quotas and CPU affinity rather than misleading host values — then sets RAM and VRAM budgets via resource.setrlimit and torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction so a script raises a catchable error instead of being OOM-killed, and picks the right torch wheel for the detected device. ALWAYS read before loading a large dataset, installing torch, or sizing batches and worker counts. Triggers: how much RAM or CPU or GPU is available, container memory limit, cgroup, OOM killed, MemoryError, os.cpu_count reports host cores, nproc, VRAM, CUDA available, CPU-only torch build, dataset too big for memory, chunking. NOT for spreading work across that hardware once measured (aii-parallel-computing), staged scale-up runs against a time budget (aii-long-running-tasks), or renting cloud machines (aii-runpod)."
---

**Step 1** — Run `bash scripts/get_hardware.sh` (relative to this skill's directory).

Read the `=== CGROUP ===` section carefully. If `Type: cgroup v1` or `cgroup v2`:
- You are in a **container with hard resource limits**. Exceeding them = OOM kill, no recovery.
- **Never** use `psutil.virtual_memory().total`, `free -h`, `/proc/meminfo`, `os.cpu_count()`, or `nproc` for resource limits — these report **host** values, not your container's allocation.
- **Always** read limits from the cgroup paths shown in the output, or use the Python helpers below.
- For **runtime memory monitoring**, read current usage from cgroup too:
  - v2: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.current`
  - v1: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes`

**Step 2** — Use Step 1 results to pick package variants **before** installing.

Defaults often target the most powerful environment — PyPI's `torch` ships with CUDA libs even on CPU-only hosts. Wrong variant = wasted disk, slow setup, possible import-time failures.

If `=== GPU ===` shows `No GPU`, install torch's CPU build (skips ~4.5GB of CUDA libs):
```bash
uv pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
Same idea for any library whose wheel selection depends on detected hardware (GPU/CPU-only builds, architecture-specific wheels).

After install, sanity-check imports right away (`python -c "import torch"`). Disk-pressure or interrupted installs leave half-built wheels (e.g. `libtorch_global_deps.so` missing) — catch these before the experiment runs.

**Step 3** — Set Python constants from the Step 1 results:
```python
import os, math, torch, psutil
from pathlib import Path

def _detect_cpus() -> int:
    """Detect actual CPU allocation (containers/pods/bare metal)."""
    try:  # cgroups v2 quota
        parts = Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max").read_text().split()
        if parts[0] != "max":
            return math.ceil(int(parts[0]) / int(parts[1]))
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # cgroups v1 quota
        q = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us").read_text())
        p = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us").read_text())
        if q > 0:
            return math.ceil(q / p)
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # CPU affinity (cpuset — used by RunPod, Docker --cpuset-cpus)
        return len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))
    except (AttributeError, OSError): pass
    return os.cpu_count() or 1

def _container_ram_gb() -> float | None:
    """Read RAM limit from cgroup (containers/pods)."""
    for p in ["/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max", "/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes"]:
        try:
            v = Path(p).read_text().strip()
            if v != "max" and int(v) < 1_000_000_000_000:
                return int(v) / 1e9
        except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    return None

NUM_CPUS = _detect_cpus()
HAS_GPU = torch.cuda.is_available()
VRAM_GB = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_mem / 1e9 if HAS_GPU else 0
DEVICE = torch.device("cuda" if HAS_GPU else "cpu")
TOTAL_RAM_GB = _container_ram_gb() or psutil.virtual_memory().total / 1e9
AVAILABLE_RAM_GB = min(psutil.virtual_memory().available / 1e9, TOTAL_RAM_GB)
```

## Step 4 — Set Memory Limits

OOM kills the entire container. **Every script MUST set RAM and VRAM limits at startup.**

Decide the budget based on what the script actually needs. Estimate data size × 2-5x for in-memory overhead, then add ~50% breathing room for temporaries. You may use up to 90% of available RAM/VRAM, but **scale gradually** — start small (e.g. 30-50%), verify it works, then increase toward the limit. Never exceed 90% to keep a buffer for the OS, system processes, and the agent runtime itself. Going over crashes the container/machine with no recovery.

```python
import resource, psutil

_avail = psutil.virtual_memory().available
RAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate what this script needs (in bytes)
assert RAM_BUDGET < _avail, f"Budget {RAM_BUDGET/1e9:.1f}GB > available {_avail/1e9:.1f}GB"
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (RAM_BUDGET * 3, RAM_BUDGET * 3))  # 3x: virtual > RSS; raises MemoryError on exceed

if HAS_GPU:
    _free, _total = torch.cuda.mem_get_info(0)
    VRAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate GPU memory needs
    torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(min(VRAM_BUDGET / _total, 0.95))  # raises OutOfMemoryError on exceed
```

## Memory-Safe Data Processing

- **One at a time**: load one large object → process → `del obj; gc.collect()` → next
- **Load only what you need**: select specific tables/columns/rows, not entire databases
- **Test small first**: run on a sample before scaling to full data to estimate memory/time
- **Free intermediates in loops**: don't accumulate large results — aggregate incrementally
- **Size before loading**: check file/dataset size before loading; if it's >30% of `RAM_BUDGET`, chunk it

## Common Mistakes (from real crashes)

- **Skipping this skill entirely** — loading data with no RAM detection, no limits, no budget. Container OOM-killed, all agents lost.
- **Using `psutil.virtual_memory().total` instead of `_container_ram_gb()`** — reports host RAM (e.g. 66 GB) when container limit is 28 GB. You MUST use the cgroup-aware functions above.
- **Loading all tables from a multi-table database at once** — one agent loaded 14 RelBench tables simultaneously, spiked past container limit.
- **Setting no memory limits** — without `resource.setrlimit` (RAM) and `set_per_process_memory_fraction` (VRAM), a runaway script OOM-kills the container instead of raising a catchable error.
- **Using `os.cpu_count()` directly** — returns host CPUs (e.g. 192) instead of container limit (e.g. 4) on RunPod/Docker. Always use `_detect_cpus()` above which checks cgroup quota → CPU affinity → `os.cpu_count()` in order.

## Hardware Use

- Keep these results in mind for ALL subsequent tasks — don't assume more than detected
- GPU if available and parallelizable, multiprocessing if multiple CPUs
- Push available resources to their full potential — don't leave hardware idle

description: "Splits an oversized generated output file into numbered parts that each fit a size limit: checks sizes with ls -lh, writes full_data_out_1.json, full_data_out_2.json and so on into a matching directory, deletes the original, repoints the reading code at a sorted glob, and regenerates mini and preview variants per part. ALWAYS run right after a script writes JSON output, and whenever a file is too big to keep, exceeds a stated file size limit, or gets rejected for its size. Triggers: file too large, output exceeds the size limit, oversized or huge JSON, ls -lh size check after generating results, splitting or chunking an output file into parts, output directory instead of one file. NOT for: schema validation or making mini and preview variants of a file already within the limit (use aii-json), or general Python script conventions (use aii-python)."
---

## File Size Check

After generating output files, run `ls -lh` to check sizes. If ANY file exceeds the provided file size limit:

1. Create directory with same base name (e.g., `full_data_out/` for `full_data_out.json`)
2. Split into parts under the limit named: `full_data_out_1.json`, `full_data_out_2.json`, etc.
3. Place parts in directory (e.g., `full_data_out/full_data_out_1.json`, `full_data_out/full_data_out_2.json`)
4. Delete the original oversized file
5. Update the script to read from split files: `for f in sorted(glob.glob('full_data_out/full_data_out_*.json')): data.extend(json.load(open(f)))`
6. For each split part, generate its own mini/preview versions with the json skill's format script

description: "Parallelises compute-heavy Python: asyncio with aiohttp and a bounded Semaphore for I/O-bound work, ProcessPoolExecutor under the spawn start method for CPU-bound work, NumPy vectorisation and batched PyTorch on GPU with an out-of-memory halving fallback. ALWAYS read before writing any script that loops over data, issues many API calls, downloads many files, or runs heavy computation — sequential loops are the default failure mode. Triggers: parallelise, make a slow script faster, concurrency, async, aiohttp, asyncio.gather, semaphore, multiprocessing, ProcessPoolExecutor, fork deadlock with loguru, worker count, batch size, CUDA out of memory, idle GPU, retries and rate limits. NOT for detecting what hardware exists or setting RAM and VRAM budgets (aii-use-hardware), staged scale-up against a time budget (aii-long-running-tasks), or provisioning cloud pods (aii-runpod)."
---

**ALWAYS parallelize. Sequential processing is unacceptable for any non-trivial workload.** A sequential script doing 1000 API calls takes hours and fails halfway. An async version finishes in minutes with proper error handling. ALWAYS ask: "Can this run in parallel?" — the answer is almost always yes.

Read aii-use-hardware skill first → get `NUM_CPUS`, `HAS_GPU`, `VRAM_GB`, `device`. Set `NUM_WORKERS` proportional to available CPU capacity — check `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)` and scale accordingly (e.g. 30% used → use ~70% of cores).

## Decision Tree (follow strictly)

- **I/O-bound** (API calls, downloads, web, file reads) → `asyncio` + `aiohttp` with `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`. NEVER do sequential HTTP requests in a loop.
- **CPU-bound, vectorizable** → GPU available: PyTorch on device / No GPU: NumPy vectorized ops. NEVER loop over array elements in Python.
- **CPU-bound, independent items** → `ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=NUM_WORKERS)`. NEVER process items one-by-one when they're independent.
- **Sequential** → only acceptable when items have data dependencies (each depends on the previous result).

## GPU Rules

- Use up to 90% of available VRAM — scale gradually (start small, increase after each successful run, keep 10% buffer)
- Move to device → compute → move back: `torch.tensor(data, device=device)` → `.cpu().numpy()`
- OOM fallback: catch `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` → `empty_cache()` → halve batch size → retry on GPU. Keep reducing until it fits. Stay on GPU.
- Batch large data: chunk it, `del batch` between iterations to free VRAM

## Parallelism Rules

- **CPU-bound**: `ProcessPoolExecutor` + `as_completed`, pre-allocate result list indexed by submission order
- **I/O-bound**: `asyncio` + `aiohttp`, `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`, single shared `ClientSession`, `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`
- Always add `tenacity` retries for transient failures, always set timeouts on HTTP requests
- **CRITICAL — `ProcessPoolExecutor` start method**: Default `fork` deadlocks with loguru (and any threading library). ALWAYS pass `mp_context=multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")` when constructing `ProcessPoolExecutor` in any script that uses loguru, threading, or async I/O. Example:
  ```python
  import multiprocessing as mp
  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
  with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=N, mp_context=mp.get_context("spawn")) as pool:
      ...

name: aii-long-running-tasks
description: "Scales an experiment or evaluation up in stages — mini, 10, 50, 100, 200, then the largest run that fits — recording runtime at each step and extrapolating time-per-example against the remaining time budget before growing further, with background execution and hard RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_CPU caps. ALWAYS read before launching any script expected to run for many minutes or hours over a dataset. Triggers: long-running job, overnight or unattended run, time budget, how many examples fit, extrapolate runtime, start small then scale up, run in background and poll, avoid a timeout, full-dataset evaluation, resource limits. NOT for choosing the concurrency mechanism itself (aii-parallel-computing), measuring the machine's CPU, RAM or GPU (aii-use-hardware), or provisioning cloud pods (aii-runpod)."
---

## Core Principles

1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.
2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.
3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess — calculate.
4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.
5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.

---

## Gradual Scaling Sequence

Run code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.

Substitute your actual file names:
- `{mini_file}` — mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace
- `{full_file}` — full dataset from dependency workspace
- `{script}` — your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)
- `{schema}` — JSON schema to validate output against

**STEP 1 — MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.

**STEP 2 — 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.

**STEP 3 — 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.

**STEP 4 — 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.

**STEP 5 — 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.

**STEP 6 — MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear — account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.

## Final Testing Phase

After completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:

mini → 10 → 50 → 100 → 200 → max

At each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.

---

## Background Execution

For any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:

1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`
2. While it runs, use the time productively:
   - Sanity-check previous outputs
   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)
   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale
   - Prepare the next step
3. Check back on the background task to get results
4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run

---

## Resource Limits

Set hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).

Python example using stdlib `resource` module:
```python
import resource
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time
```
Exceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.

## Monitoring

At each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.

title: Visual cache access trace dataset
summary: >-
  Build three cache-access trace datasets (stationary hot clusters, popularity shift, cold-start), each pairing a real request
  sequence + per-item popularity with real images and locally-extracted CLIP embeddings, plus per-item cluster/popularity
  metadata, split by temporal order. This supplies the raw inputs the downstream conformal-cache-admission experiment needs
  to replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU and the new method.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  The ideal dataset pairs a REAL request trace (item IDs, ordered request sequence, timestamps, per-item request counts showing
  Zipf/heavy-skew popularity) with REAL images so that CLIP embeddings and semantic clusters are genuine and reproducible.
  Concretely: 1,000–20,000 unique items per regime with ~100k–1M total requests; each item carries a 512-d CLIP (ViT-B/32)
  embedding, a semantic cluster id, and its true popularity (request count); PLUS the full ordered request sequence is retained
  (not collapsed to aggregates) so the experiment can replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU/bandit/Chameleon policies and compute hit/miss.
  Total footprint under ~300MB. Three regimes with distinct dynamics. Folds split by timestamp (temporal order preserved,
  no future leakage). The dataset must be raw data ONLY: NO hit/miss labels, conformal intervals, or admission decisions should
  be computed here — those are downstream experiment/derived outputs.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  CRITICAL CORRECTION TO THE DIRECTION: (1) OpenRouter does NOT expose CLIP/image-embedding endpoints — it is a text-LLM gateway. Extract embeddings LOCALLY instead using open_clip_torch (ViT-B/32, 512-d) or transformers.CLIPModel on CPU; this also means the $10 OpenRouter budget is not needed for this artifact. (2) Real cache traces (Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, SNIA IOTTA block traces) ship item IDs + request sequences + counts but NOT the image bytes, so visual embeddings cannot come from the trace itself — the access pattern and the images must come from two real sources and be paired procedurally.

  PHASE A — Acquire real access-pattern ground truth: Search HuggingFace and GitHub for public cache/CDN trace datasets. Named candidates to check: (a) the Caffeine simulator traces (github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Simulator, Traces section) which reference the Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, Gloe/S3/UMass traces; (b) the pennshen trace repos on GitHub (LC/CacheLib-traces / PBC) hosting large CDN traces; (c) SNIA IOTTA block-I/O repository (iotta.snia.org). Use aii-hf-datasets search (queries: 'cache trace', 'cdn access log', 'web trace', 'request trace') and aii-web-tools search as fallback. Goal: an ordered request stream + per-item request counts that exhibit heavy-tailed popularity. If no directly loadable trace is found, RECORD the trace's Zipf/skew statistics and request-count distribution and use them as the ground-truth generator for the request sequences (still real-derived, not fabricated ab initio).

  PHASE B — Acquire real images: Use aii-hf-datasets to pull a loadable image corpus — ImageNet-1k subset (via timm/HF mirror) or COCO (e.g. a HF coco/ image subset) is preferred for real semantic clusters (animals, vehicles, food, scenes). Target a few thousand down to 20k images. Confirm 'loadable=True' before choosing.

  PHASE C — Pair and embed: Assign each trace item to a real image deterministically (seeded), cluster items by image class/label into a 'cluster_id' column. Extract 512-d CLIP embeddings locally (CLIP ViT-B/32, CPU-batch, float32→float16 if needed for size).

  PHASE D — Construct THREE regime datasets (this is the 'construct synthetic but realistic traces' step from the direction, applied per regime): (1) Stationary hot clusters — stable Zipf popularity, a few dominant hot clusters; (2) Sudden popularity shift — request mass migrates from old clusters to new ones midway through the sequence; (3) Cold-start — a stream of previously-unseen items with no warm-up. Keep the request sequence ordered with timestamps in each.

  PHASE E — Split by temporal order into train/validation/test (no shuffling across time), write each item as a row {item_id, request_sequence_or_ordered_events, timestamp, embedding (float list), cluster_id, popularity_count, regime, metadata_fold}. Validate against the repo schema with aii-json, and generate full/mini/preview variants. Final output paths: full_*.json, mini_*.json, preview_*.json per regime.

  FAILURE HANDLING: If no real trace is obtainable/loadable, fall back to real-derived popularity params from the documented traces (Phase A records them first) and represent that provenance explicitly in metadata instead of silently synthesizing. If a single 512-d CLIP model is too heavy for CPU, downscale to ViT-B/32 fp16 or a 128-d projection and note it. Do not compute hit/miss or conformal intervals in this artifact.

Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-python, aii-long-running-tasks, aii-json, aii-file-size-limit, aii-use-hardware, aii-parallel-computing.
TODO 2. Read skill files for your data sources (see <available_data_sources>) and domain handbook if applicable (see <available_domain_handbooks>). Based on plan and context, decide which source(s) to use. Include everything specified in the artifact plan, but you may also collect additional relevant data beyond what's listed. Run 24 diverse searches across chosen source(s) — BROAD, GENERAL terms, not very specific. Parallelize where supported.
TODO 3. Identify the 12 most promising datasets. IMPORTANT: Only consider datasets under 300MB. Preview/inspect sample rows for each candidate. Parallelize previews.
TODO 4. Research each candidate BEFORE choosing which to download. For each, search the web (aii-web-tools skill): dataset name, papers citing it, original source/task, popularity. Red flags: no search results, no papers, anonymized features (F1, F2...), <100 downloads, no documentation. Green flags: papers using it, clear documentation, meaningful features, established benchmark. Also consider: will features/structure allow meaningful evaluation of the planned method?
TODO 5. Decide which to KEEP vs DISCARD. Look for: clear structure, relevant fields, quality examples matching requirements, confirmed provenance. Determine which 6 datasets have the most suitable data. Download and save to `temp/datasets/`. Parallelize downloads.

id: gen_plan_dataset_1_idx2
type: dataset
title: Visual cache access trace dataset
summary: >-
  Build three cache-access trace datasets (stationary hot clusters, popularity shift, cold-start), each pairing a real request
  sequence + per-item popularity with real images and locally-extracted CLIP embeddings, plus per-item cluster/popularity
  metadata, split by temporal order. This supplies the raw inputs the downstream conformal-cache-admission experiment needs
  to replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU and the new method.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  The ideal dataset pairs a REAL request trace (item IDs, ordered request sequence, timestamps, per-item request counts showing
  Zipf/heavy-skew popularity) with REAL images so that CLIP embeddings and semantic clusters are genuine and reproducible.
  Concretely: 1,000–20,000 unique items per regime with ~100k–1M total requests; each item carries a 512-d CLIP (ViT-B/32)
  embedding, a semantic cluster id, and its true popularity (request count); PLUS the full ordered request sequence is retained
  (not collapsed to aggregates) so the experiment can replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU/bandit/Chameleon policies and compute hit/miss.
  Total footprint under ~300MB. Three regimes with distinct dynamics. Folds split by timestamp (temporal order preserved,
  no future leakage). The dataset must be raw data ONLY: NO hit/miss labels, conformal intervals, or admission decisions should
  be computed here — those are downstream experiment/derived outputs.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  CRITICAL CORRECTION TO THE DIRECTION: (1) OpenRouter does NOT expose CLIP/image-embedding endpoints — it is a text-LLM gateway. Extract embeddings LOCALLY instead using open_clip_torch (ViT-B/32, 512-d) or transformers.CLIPModel on CPU; this also means the $10 OpenRouter budget is not needed for this artifact. (2) Real cache traces (Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, SNIA IOTTA block traces) ship item IDs + request sequences + counts but NOT the image bytes, so visual embeddings cannot come from the trace itself — the access pattern and the images must come from two real sources and be paired procedurally.

  PHASE A — Acquire real access-pattern ground truth: Search HuggingFace and GitHub for public cache/CDN trace datasets. Named candidates to check: (a) the Caffeine simulator traces (github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Simulator, Traces section) which reference the Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, Gloe/S3/UMass traces; (b) the pennshen trace repos on GitHub (LC/CacheLib-traces / PBC) hosting large CDN traces; (c) SNIA IOTTA block-I/O repository (iotta.snia.org). Use aii-hf-datasets search (queries: 'cache trace', 'cdn access log', 'web trace', 'request trace') and aii-web-tools search as fallback. Goal: an ordered request stream + per-item request counts that exhibit heavy-tailed popularity. If no directly loadable trace is found, RECORD the trace's Zipf/skew statistics and request-count distribution and use them as the ground-truth generator for the request sequences (still real-derived, not fabricated ab initio).

  PHASE B — Acquire real images: Use aii-hf-datasets to pull a loadable image corpus — ImageNet-1k subset (via timm/HF mirror) or COCO (e.g. a HF coco/ image subset) is preferred for real semantic clusters (animals, vehicles, food, scenes). Target a few thousand down to 20k images. Confirm 'loadable=True' before choosing.

  PHASE C — Pair and embed: Assign each trace item to a real image deterministically (seeded), cluster items by image class/label into a 'cluster_id' column. Extract 512-d CLIP embeddings locally (CLIP ViT-B/32, CPU-batch, float32→float16 if needed for size).

  PHASE D — Construct THREE regime datasets (this is the 'construct synthetic but realistic traces' step from the direction, applied per regime): (1) Stationary hot clusters — stable Zipf popularity, a few dominant hot clusters; (2) Sudden popularity shift — request mass migrates from old clusters to new ones midway through the sequence; (3) Cold-start — a stream of previously-unseen items with no warm-up. Keep the request sequence ordered with timestamps in each.

  PHASE E — Split by temporal order into train/validation/test (no shuffling across time), write each item as a row {item_id, request_sequence_or_ordered_events, timestamp, embedding (float list), cluster_id, popularity_count, regime, metadata_fold}. Validate against the repo schema with aii-json, and generate full/mini/preview variants. Final output paths: full_*.json, mini_*.json, preview_*.json per regime.

  FAILURE HANDLING: If no real trace is obtainable/loadable, fall back to real-derived popularity params from the documented traces (Phase A records them first) and represent that provenance explicitly in metadata instead of silently synthesizing. If a single 512-d CLIP model is too heavy for CPU, downscale to ViT-B/32 fp16 or a 128-d projection and note it. Do not compute hit/miss or conformal intervals in this artifact.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. For the top 6 datasets, create data.py (uv inline script) that: loads from temp/datasets/, standardizes to exp_sel_data_out.json schema (aii-json skill), extracts all examples per dataset, handles domain requirements, saves to full_data_out.json.

Each data ROW must be a separate example — do NOT create one example per dataset or per fold. Each data point (row, sample, instance) = one example. 500 rows → 500 examples. The output is GROUPED BY DATASET:
```json
{
  "datasets": [
    {
      "dataset": "iris",
      "examples": [
        {"input": "...", "output": "...", "metadata_fold": 2, "metadata_feature_names": [...]},
        ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "dataset": "adult_census",
      "examples": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```
Per-example required fields:
- `input`: input features/text (tabular: JSON string of feature values)
- `output`: target/label (as string)
Per-example optional metadata via `metadata_<name>` fields (flat, not nested object):
- `metadata_fold`: fold assignment (int), `metadata_feature_names`: feature name list, `metadata_task_type`: "classification"/"regression", `metadata_n_classes`: number of classes, `metadata_row_index`: original row index, etc.
Do NOT use `split`, `dataset`, or `context` as per-example fields. Dataset name goes at the group level, metadata goes in `metadata_*` fields.
TODO 2. Run 'uv run data.py' and fix errors. Validate full_data_out.json against exp_sel_data_out.json schema (aii-json skill) — fix errors. Generate preview, mini, full versions with aii-json skill's format script.
TODO 3. Read preview to inspect examples. Choose THE BEST 3 DATASETS based on domain requirements and artifact objective. Be very attentive to meticulously and exhaustively fix any errors in your code.

id: gen_plan_dataset_1_idx2
type: dataset
title: Visual cache access trace dataset
summary: >-
  Build three cache-access trace datasets (stationary hot clusters, popularity shift, cold-start), each pairing a real request
  sequence + per-item popularity with real images and locally-extracted CLIP embeddings, plus per-item cluster/popularity
  metadata, split by temporal order. This supplies the raw inputs the downstream conformal-cache-admission experiment needs
  to replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU and the new method.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  The ideal dataset pairs a REAL request trace (item IDs, ordered request sequence, timestamps, per-item request counts showing
  Zipf/heavy-skew popularity) with REAL images so that CLIP embeddings and semantic clusters are genuine and reproducible.
  Concretely: 1,000–20,000 unique items per regime with ~100k–1M total requests; each item carries a 512-d CLIP (ViT-B/32)
  embedding, a semantic cluster id, and its true popularity (request count); PLUS the full ordered request sequence is retained
  (not collapsed to aggregates) so the experiment can replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU/bandit/Chameleon policies and compute hit/miss.
  Total footprint under ~300MB. Three regimes with distinct dynamics. Folds split by timestamp (temporal order preserved,
  no future leakage). The dataset must be raw data ONLY: NO hit/miss labels, conformal intervals, or admission decisions should
  be computed here — those are downstream experiment/derived outputs.
dataset_search_plan: |-
  CRITICAL CORRECTION TO THE DIRECTION: (1) OpenRouter does NOT expose CLIP/image-embedding endpoints — it is a text-LLM gateway. Extract embeddings LOCALLY instead using open_clip_torch (ViT-B/32, 512-d) or transformers.CLIPModel on CPU; this also means the $10 OpenRouter budget is not needed for this artifact. (2) Real cache traces (Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, SNIA IOTTA block traces) ship item IDs + request sequences + counts but NOT the image bytes, so visual embeddings cannot come from the trace itself — the access pattern and the images must come from two real sources and be paired procedurally.

  PHASE A — Acquire real access-pattern ground truth: Search HuggingFace and GitHub for public cache/CDN trace datasets. Named candidates to check: (a) the Caffeine simulator traces (github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Simulator, Traces section) which reference the Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, Gloe/S3/UMass traces; (b) the pennshen trace repos on GitHub (LC/CacheLib-traces / PBC) hosting large CDN traces; (c) SNIA IOTTA block-I/O repository (iotta.snia.org). Use aii-hf-datasets search (queries: 'cache trace', 'cdn access log', 'web trace', 'request trace') and aii-web-tools search as fallback. Goal: an ordered request stream + per-item request counts that exhibit heavy-tailed popularity. If no directly loadable trace is found, RECORD the trace's Zipf/skew statistics and request-count distribution and use them as the ground-truth generator for the request sequences (still real-derived, not fabricated ab initio).

  PHASE B — Acquire real images: Use aii-hf-datasets to pull a loadable image corpus — ImageNet-1k subset (via timm/HF mirror) or COCO (e.g. a HF coco/ image subset) is preferred for real semantic clusters (animals, vehicles, food, scenes). Target a few thousand down to 20k images. Confirm 'loadable=True' before choosing.

  PHASE C — Pair and embed: Assign each trace item to a real image deterministically (seeded), cluster items by image class/label into a 'cluster_id' column. Extract 512-d CLIP embeddings locally (CLIP ViT-B/32, CPU-batch, float32→float16 if needed for size).

  PHASE D — Construct THREE regime datasets (this is the 'construct synthetic but realistic traces' step from the direction, applied per regime): (1) Stationary hot clusters — stable Zipf popularity, a few dominant hot clusters; (2) Sudden popularity shift — request mass migrates from old clusters to new ones midway through the sequence; (3) Cold-start — a stream of previously-unseen items with no warm-up. Keep the request sequence ordered with timestamps in each.

  PHASE E — Split by temporal order into train/validation/test (no shuffling across time), write each item as a row {item_id, request_sequence_or_ordered_events, timestamp, embedding (float list), cluster_id, popularity_count, regime, metadata_fold}. Validate against the repo schema with aii-json, and generate full/mini/preview variants. Final output paths: full_*.json, mini_*.json, preview_*.json per regime.

  FAILURE HANDLING: If no real trace is obtainable/loadable, fall back to real-derived popularity params from the documented traces (Phase A records them first) and represent that provenance explicitly in metadata instead of silently synthesizing. If a single 512-d CLIP model is too heavy for CPU, downscale to ViT-B/32 fp16 or a 128-d projection and note it. Do not compute hit/miss or conformal intervals in this artifact.

- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<available_data_sources>
Use the sources appropriate to your task. Read the relevant skill file BEFORE using each source.

- **HuggingFace Hub** (HF) — ML datasets (NLP, vision, tabular, benchmarks)
- **Our World in Data** (OWID) — Global statistics (energy, health, economics, environment, demographics)
- **Alternate methods** — Python/shell (sklearn.datasets, openml, direct URL, APIs, etc.)

If the plan specifies a source or one fits better, use it.
You may combine sources. Use web search (aii-web-tools skill) to research candidates (background, papers, provenance) — NOT to find/download datasets.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for dataset selection, evaluation metrics, agent orchestration patterns.

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-python, aii-long-running-tasks, aii-json, aii-file-size-limit, aii-use-hardware, aii-parallel-computing.
TODO 2. Read skill files for your data sources (see <available_data_sources>) and domain handbook if applicable (see <available_domain_handbooks>). Based on plan and context, decide which source(s) to use. Include everything specified in the artifact plan, but you may also collect additional relevant data beyond what's listed. Run 24 diverse searches across chosen source(s) — BROAD, GENERAL terms, not very specific. Parallelize where supported.
TODO 3. Identify the 12 most promising datasets. IMPORTANT: Only consider datasets under 300MB. Preview/inspect sample rows for each candidate. Parallelize previews.
TODO 4. Research each candidate BEFORE choosing which to download. For each, search the web (aii-web-tools skill): dataset name, papers citing it, original source/task, popularity. Red flags: no search results, no papers, anonymized features (F1, F2...), <100 downloads, no documentation. Green flags: papers using it, clear documentation, meaningful features, established benchmark. Also consider: will features/structure allow meaningful evaluation of the planned method?
TODO 5. Decide which to KEEP vs DISCARD. Look for: clear structure, relevant fields, quality examples matching requirements, confirmed provenance. Determine which 6 datasets have the most suitable data. Download and save to `temp/datasets/`. Parallelize downloads.

(2) Real cache traces (Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, SNIA IOTTA block traces) ship item IDs + request sequences + counts but NOT the image bytes, so visual embeddings cannot come from the trace itself — the access pattern and the images must come from two real sources and be paired procedurally.

  PHASE A — Acquire real access-pattern ground truth: Search HuggingFace and GitHub for public cache/CDN trace datasets. Named candidates to check: (a) the Caffeine simulator traces (github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Simulator, Traces section) which reference the Tencent photo CDN, Microsoft, Wikipedia, Gloe/S3/UMass traces; (b) the pennshen trace repos on GitHub (LC/CacheLib-traces / PBC) hosting large CDN traces; (c) SNIA IOTTA block-I/O repository (iotta.snia.org). Use aii-hf-datasets search (queries: 'cache trace', 'cdn access log', 'web trace', 'request trace') and aii-web-tools search as fallback. Goal: an ordered request stream + per-item request counts that exhibit heavy-tailed popularity. If no directly loadable trace is found, RECORD the trace's Zipf/skew statistics and request-count distribution and use them as the ground-truth generator for the request sequences (still real-derived, not fabricated ab initio).

  PHASE B — Acquire real images: Use aii-hf-datasets to pull a loadable image corpus — ImageNet-1k subset (via timm/HF mirror) or COCO (e.g. a HF coco/ image subset) is preferred for real semantic clusters (animals, vehicles, food, scenes). Target a few thousand down to 20k images. Confirm 'loadable=True' before choosing.

  PHASE C — Pair and embed: Assign each trace item to a real image deterministically (seeded), cluster items by image class/label into a 'cluster_id' column. Extract 512-d CLIP embeddings locally (CLIP ViT-B/32, CPU-batch, float32→float16 if needed for size).

  PHASE D — Construct THREE regime datasets (this is the 'construct synthetic but realistic traces' step from the direction, applied per regime): (1) Stationary hot clusters — stable Zipf popularity, a few dominant hot clusters; (2) Sudden popularity shift — request mass migrates from old clusters to new ones midway through the sequence; (3) Cold-start — a stream of previously-unseen items with no warm-up. Keep the request sequence ordered with timestamps in each.

  PHASE E — Split by temporal order into train/validation/test (no shuffling across time), write each item as a row {item_id, request_sequence_or_ordered_events, timestamp, embedding (float list), cluster_id, popularity_count, regime, metadata_fold}. Validate against the repo schema with aii-json, and generate full/mini/preview variants. Final output paths: full_*.json, mini_*.json, preview_*.json per regime.

  FAILURE HANDLING: If no real trace is obtainable/loadable, fall back to real-derived popularity params from the documented traces (Phase A records them first) and represent that provenance explicitly in metadata instead of silently synthesizing. If a single 512-d CLIP model is too heavy for CPU, downscale to ViT-B/32 fp16 or a 128-d projection and note it. Do not compute hit/miss or conformal intervals in this artifact.

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. For the top 6 datasets, create data.py (uv inline script) that: loads from temp/datasets/, standardizes to exp_sel_data_out.json schema (aii-json skill), extracts all examples per dataset, handles domain requirements, saves to full_data_out.json.

Each data ROW must be a separate example — do NOT create one example per dataset or per fold. Each data point (row, sample, instance) = one example. 500 rows → 500 examples. The output is GROUPED BY DATASET:
```json
{
  "datasets": [
    {
      "dataset": "iris",
      "examples": [
        {"input": "...", "output": "...", "metadata_fold": 2, "metadata_feature_names": [...]},
        ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "dataset": "adult_census",
      "examples": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```
Per-example required fields:
- `input`: input features/text (tabular: JSON string of feature values)
- `output`: target/label (as string)
Per-example optional metadata via `metadata_<name>` fields (flat, not nested object):
- `metadata_fold`: fold assignment (int), `metadata_feature_names`: feature name list, `metadata_task_type`: "classification"/"regression", `metadata_n_classes`: number of classes, `metadata_row_index`: original row index, etc.
Do NOT use `split`, `dataset`, or `context` as per-example fields. Dataset name goes at the group level, metadata goes in `metadata_*` fields.
TODO 2. Run 'uv run data.py' and fix errors. Validate full_data_out.json against exp_sel_data_out.json schema (aii-json skill) — fix errors. Generate preview, mini, full versions with aii-json skill's format script.
TODO 3. Read preview to inspect examples. Choose THE BEST 3 DATASETS based on domain requirements and artifact objective. Be very attentive to meticulously and exhaustively fix any errors in your code.

title: Visual cache access trace dataset
summary: >-
  Build three cache-access trace datasets (stationary hot clusters, popularity shift, cold-start), each pairing a real request
  sequence + per-item popularity with real images and locally-extracted CLIP embeddings, plus per-item cluster/popularity
  metadata, split by temporal order. This supplies the raw inputs the downstream conformal-cache-admission experiment needs
  to replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU and the new method.
runpod_compute_profile: cpu_heavy
ideal_dataset_criteria: >-
  The ideal dataset pairs a REAL request trace (item IDs, ordered request sequence, timestamps, per-item request counts showing
  Zipf/heavy-skew popularity) with REAL images so that CLIP embeddings and semantic clusters are genuine and reproducible.
  Concretely: 1,000–20,000 unique items per regime with ~100k–1M total requests; each item carries a 512-d CLIP (ViT-B/32)
  embedding, a semantic cluster id, and its true popularity (request count); PLUS the full ordered request sequence is retained
  (not collapsed to aggregates) so the experiment can replay TinyLFU/ARC2/LRU/bandit/Chameleon policies and compute hit/miss.
  Total footprint under ~300MB. Three regimes with distinct dynamics. Folds split by timestamp (temporal order preserved,
  no future leakage). The dataset must be raw data ONLY: NO hit/miss labels, conformal intervals, or admission decisions should
  be computed here — those are downstream experiment/derived outputs.
